# Circle of 5ths -> 4 Half Circles

## Intro
The circle of 5ths for me is a bit confusing 
in its visual representation. I cant think or read 
counter clockwise flats as I can clockwise with sharps,
so I made this trick for me to be able to think faster.
Additionally this also helps with getting chords that 
are not displayed on the circle of fifths.

### Problem 1: Missing 6 notes/keys

If we put every note possible on a table, we get:
- A  B  C  D  E  F  G 
- Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb
- A# B# C# D# E# F# G#

If we match this table with notes on the circle of fifths:
```js
                C       
       F _____________ G  
       /               \
  Bb /                   |  D 
    /                     \
   |                       |
Eb |                       | A 
   |                       |
    |                     | 
 Ab  |                   | E
      |                 /
    Db |______________  B  
   C#          F#       Cb
               Gb
```
We get:
- A  B  C  D  E  F  G 
- Ab Bb Cb Db Eb    Gb
-                F#   

With the circle of 5ths we are missing
these 6 notes:
- A  B  C  D  E  F  G 
-                Fb

How do we derive the missing notes?
We get this by the 4 half circles shown below


### Problem 2: Thinking About Flats Fast

The second problem is that I for the life of me cannot
read a circle counter clockwise as fast as I can clockwise.
Im guessing its because my brain has been wired to read 
right to left or just read a clock 1->12, just a small quirk.

How do we fix the slowness problem?
We can represent the 4 half circles all as clock wise
using the 4 right halves of a circle.

### Solution: 4 Right Half Circles

Start with the circle of fifths and split it in half.
```js
// Start with the right half of circle of 5ths
// then extend it
    C       
    ______ G  
          \
           |  D 
            \
             |
             | A 
             |
            | 
           | E
          /
    ______  B  
   F#           
```

Now, use the same shape for the original circle of fifths
```js
// 2 halves
    C              C              Cb              C#
    _____ G       ______ F        _____ Fb       _____  G#
          \              \              \              \
           |  D           | Bb           |              |  D#
            \              \             \               \
             |             |              |               |
             | A           | Eb            |              | A#
             |             |              |               |
            |             |              |               |
           | E           | Ab           |               | E#
          /             /              /               /
    ____  B       ______ Db         ____           ____ B#
   F#              Gb                               
```

And then lets add in the notes we were missing from problem 1:
- A  B  C  D  E  F  G 
-                Fb
```js
// 4 halves
    C              C              Cb              C#
    _____ G       ______ F        _____ Fb       _____  G#
          \              \              \              \
           |  D           | Bb           |              |  D#
            \              \             \               \
             |             |              |               |
             | A           | Eb            |              | A#
             |             |              |               |
            |             |              |               |
           | E           | Ab           |               | E#
          /             /              /               /
    ____  B       ______ Db         ____           ____ B#
   F#              Gb                               
```
Now we have a visual diagram of:
- How to derive all 21 notes, by modifying original notes/chords
on the circle (e.g., D -> D#, just sharp every note in the D chord
- We can traverse flats quicker by going by 4ths clockwise

# The ~144 Chords

## Intro

Since brute force memorization seems to ALWAYS be the answer
im going to write out every possible combination of 'beginner'
chords and sort the chords into a derivation shortcut 
similar to the circle of fifths. Here we can use a graph structure
and see the original parent chords and its children derived chords.

To start, we will learn 13 basic chords.
They are derived from the major, minor, and sus triads
to form graph structures from the parent triad.

## Major Triad -> Seventh + Sixth Graph ::5::
```js 
                Major: 1 3 5    
                  |      |   \  
                / |      |    Aug: 1 3 5#  
               /  |      |          
Major 7: 1 3 5 7  |      |
                 / \     (major triad)  
                /   \    Aug Maj 7: 1 3 5 7#    
Dominant: 1 3 5 7b   \            = 1 3 5 1          
                      \ 
                     (diminished major 7)
                     Major 6th: 1 3 5 6 
                              = 1 3 5 7bb     
```

## Minor Triad -> Seventh + Sixth Graph ::6::
```js
                Minor: 1 3b 5
                   |    | \   
                 / |    |   Dim: 1 3b 5b
Minor 7: 1 3b 5 7b |    | \   
                   |    |  \    
                  /     |   Half Dim 7: 1 3b 5b 7b  
(diminished minor 7)     \
Minor 6th: 1 3b 5 6       \
         = 1 3b 5 7bb     Full Dim 7: 1 3b 5b 7bb  
```

## Sus 2, Sus 4 Triads -> Dominant Sus 7 Extensions ::1::
```js
// A sus chord removes the 3rd in order to leave it ambiguous 
// as to whether its a major or minor chord (since the 3rd of a triad
// determines its type). The sus replaces the third with another note
// (usually the 2nd or 4th), leading to the eventual resolving to
// the third to be satisfying.

// Sus extensions (past 7th) are usually dominant with a 7b,
// but major sus with 7 is possible but again less common

// diminished sus 7bb is just a 6, so we count that as a 6th chord
// aug sus 7# is just a 1, so we count that as a triad
                
           ambiguous triad
            /     |    \
  Sus 4: 1 4 5    |      Sus 2: C D G 
                / |             1 2 5
Sus 9: 1 4 5 7b 9 | \  
(doubled 2/9)     |  \ 
                /    Sus 11: 1 4 5 b7 9 11
               /     (doubled 2/9, 4/11)
              /
Sus 13: 1 4 5 7b 9 11 13        
(doubled 2/9, 4/11, 6/13)
```
