# Pattern: Hieroglyphs + Tetris
Pg 1

Clean diagram of 5 hieroglyphs and extending the idea
that each of these is a rotation of the other. 
When we iterate over 1 hieroglyph, we move the root up
by 2 strings. 

```python
    string   hieroglyph 
     1/6      islands
      5       covenant
      4       reaching
      3         key
      2        chest
     1/6      islands
```

# Practice: Drum Notation + Basic Rhythms
Pg 2-5

# Diagrams: Chords in Relative Hieroglyphs
Pg 6-16

Really great diagrams demonstrating the 'why'.

- Major Chords, in all 5 positions
- Major Chords, in all 5 positions extended outward by 1
- Major Chords, in all 5 positions across the fretboard

- Minor Chords, in all 5 positions
- Minor Chords, in all 5 positions extended outward by 1
- Minor Chords, with base chords + extensions.

- All Chords, in all 5 positions, across the fretboard
