Sad that I only found this now, happy that i did though, enjoy!

Intro Lecture: The Diminished Family Theory

Before we go into the application of these scales, let's get into how Barry came up with this diminished theory.

This concept has actually been around for a long time as it's been a common arranging technique used for early big band writing.

Barry discovered it from a completely different angle and categorized it, gave it names, and has been developing the endless possibilities ever since.

So Barry has quite a unique perspective on the theoretical side of music which you wont find taught at any music school. 

He takes quite a spiritual approach starting with the 12 notes of the chromatin scale.

Chromatic scale: C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B

Now these are all the notes in our western music and Barry refers to this as our musical universe, or the 12 disciples, or the 12 zodiac signs, or the 12 months of the year. But basically, he refers to these 12 notes as being god (stay with me now). He then goes on to say that God then made man and woman or Adam and Eve, which he refers to as being to 2 whole tone scales. 

Whole tone starting on C: C D E Gb Ab Bb
Whole tone starting on Db: Db Eb F G A B

Giving you all the possible notes in our universe.

So what happened next, the man and woman had children, 3 children, which Barry refers to as the 3 possible diminished chords available to us in our musical universe.

C diminished: C Eb Gb Bbb  (C Eb Gb A)
Db diminished: Db Fb G Bb  (C# E G A#)
D diminished: D F Ab Cb (D F Ab B)

Each of these 3 diminished chords, as Barry puts it, share a 50/50 split of dna, or chromosomes from the 2 whole tone scales. 

Co7: C Eb Gb A -> (C Gb) C whole tone scale, (Eb A) Db whole tone scale
Dbo7: Db Fb G Bb -> (Db G) Db whole tone scale, (Fb Bb) C whole tone scale
Do7: D F Ab Cb -> (D Ab) C whole tone scale, (F Cb) Db whole tone scale

So by changing a couple of notes, you can get to any diminished chord from either one of the whole tone scales which is already giving us some options to create harmonic movement with.

This way of thinking is all very logical and a really elegant way to see these relationships. But here it is with a more mathematical view. 

If 12 is all of our notes, the chromatic scale, or god,  if we divide that by 6, we get 2 6 note scales, the 2 whole tone scales, or man and woman. Divide 12 by 4 and we get the 3 4 tone diminished chords, the children. We can also continue this by dividing 12 by 3 giving us the 4 augmented triads. And finally if we divide 12 by 2, we get the 6 possible tritones.

God: 
C Db D Eb E F Gb G Ab A Bb B 		-> 12/12 = 1 Chromatic Scale
Woman and Man: 
	C D E Gb Ab Bb 	Db Eb F G A B 	-> 12/6 = 2 Whole Tone scales
3 Children:
	C Eb Gb A 	Db E G Bb	D F Ab B	-> 12/4 = 3 Diminished Chords
4 Augmented:
	C E Ab	      Db D A      D Gb Bb      Eb G B	-> 12/3 = 4 Augmented Chords
6 Tritones
	C Gb    Db G    D Ab    Eb A    E Bb    F B 	-> 12/2 = 6 Tritones


The Diminished Family
So what we then do next in order to get all the other chords which are used in what Barry calls the diminished family is we move certain diminished chord tones around. 

Diminished One Down to Dominant 7
So if we take a Co7, which is exactly the same as an Ebo7, Gbo7, and Ao7. But if we lower one of the chord tones, we get a dominant 7th chord. We can do this to any of the chord tones, which will result in 4 different dominant 7th chords.

Co7 + lower a chord tone = Dominant 7th Chord
Because:
		 
Diminished: note1 -> m3 -> note2 ->  m3  -> note3 -> m3 -> note4 -> m3 -> note1
Lowered root
Dominant 7: note1 -> M3 -> note2 -> m3 -> note3 -> m3 -> note4 -> M2 -> note1






Examples :
—---------------------------------------------
C Eb Gb A  (Co7)
Lowered root
(head transition of notes Eb -> D#, Gb -> F#)
	= 
B Eb Gb A (B D# F# A) 	(B Dom7)
—---------------------------------------------
Eb Gb A C
Lowered Root 
(head transition of notes Eb -> D#, Gb -> F#)
	=
Ebb Gb A C (D F# A C) 	 (D Dom7)
—---------------------------------------------
Gb A C Eb
Lowered Root
(no head transition since b match)
=
F A C Eb			(F Dom7)
—---------------------------------------------
A C Eb Gb
Lowered Root
(no head transition since b match) 
=
Ab C Eb Gb			(Ab Dom7)
—---------------------------------------------

This is also a way to see where the 8 note W/H or H/W diminished scale comes from, because if you pu t together the 4 related dominants roots, which are below each diminished chord tone,
they make up another diminished chord, which is a semitone below the original diminished chord.

C -> B, Eb -> D, Gb -> F, A -> Ab   = B D F Ab (Bo7)
If you put the notes of these 2 diminished chords together, they make up the 8 note diminished scale. So Co7 + Bo7 = 8 note diminished Scale.

C Eb Gb A + B D F Ab = B C D Eb F Gb Ab A (8 note W/H or H/W diminished scale )

4 Dominant Chords, Now What?
As these 4 dominant chords are related to each other since they all come from this one diminished chord Co7 (again the same as Ebo7, Gbo7, Ao7), the 4 dominant chords all work and play well together. 

So we can stack any of these chords or triads over each other and it will bring out different tension all found within the H/W diminished scale. 

Again:
Co7 + lowered C = B7 
B Eb Gb A (B D# F# A) 	(B Dom7)

Ebo7 + lowered E = D7
Ebb Gb A C (D F# A C) 	 (D Dom7)

Gbo7 + lowered G = F7
				F A C Eb			(F Dom7)

Ao7 + lowered A = Ab7
Ab C Eb Gb			(Ab Dom7)

We can stack:

D/B7 = B D# A + D F# A
            B7           D7

F/B7 = B D# A + F A C
	B7	    F7

Ab/B7 = B D# A + Ab C Eb
	 B7	      A7

F/D7 = D F# C + F A C
	D7	    F7

Ab/D7 = D F# C + Ab C Eb
	   D7	      Ab7

B/D7 = D F# C + B D# F#
	D7	    B7

So, this is a very common bit of knowledge as most people know that a diminished chord is the same as a dominant flat 9 chord. And so by lowering one of the chord tones, it replaced th eflat nine with the dominant root creating just a regular 4 note dominant 7th chord.



Diminished One Up To Minor 6th
But what isn’t as common knowledge is that we can also raise each chord tone up a half step. So if we raise one of the diminished chord tones we now get a minor sixth chord and again we can do this to any of the diminished chord tones which will result in giving four different minor sixth chords. 

Diminished 7th -> raise a tone =  minor 6th
Because:	 
Diminished: note1 -> m3 -> note2 ->  m3  -> note3 -> m3 -> note4 -> m3 -> note1
Raised root
Dominant 7: note1 -> M2 -> note2 -> m3 -> note3 -> m3 -> note4 -> M2 -> note1


—---------------------------------------------
C Eb Gb A  (Co7)
Raised root
(head transition of notes C# -> Db)
	= 
C# Eb Gb A (Db Eb Gb A) 	-> (Gb A Db Eb) 	(Gbm6)
—---------------------------------------------
Eb Gb A C
Raised Root 
(head transition of notes Gb -> F#)
	=
E Gb A C (D F# A C)  	-> (A C D F#) 	 	(Am6)
—---------------------------------------------
Gb A C Eb
Raised Root
(no head transition since b match)
=
G A C Eb 			-> (C Eb G A)		(Cm6)
—---------------------------------------------
A C Eb Gb
Raised Root
(no head transition since b match) 
=
Bb C Eb Gb 			-> (Eb Gb Bb C)	(Ebm6)
—---------------------------------------------



Diminished Consecutive Two Down to Major 6, Two Up to Major 6
So what else can we do? Now let's lower 2 consecutive notes down a half step. Consecutive meaning 2 notes closets together in a closed position chord. So for C diminished, C and Eb consecutive. So if we lower 2 of these consecutive chords, we get a major 6th chord.

Diminished 7th -> lower 2 consecutive notes = major 6th

And because there are 4 possible consecutive notes, we get 4 different major 6th chords.

We can also move these consecutive chord tones up, which actually gives us a whole other set of 4 different major 6th chords, but still within this family.

Diminished 7th -> raise 2 consecutive notes = major 6th (different than ones from lowering)

Diminished Non Consecutive Two Down to Major 6, Two Up to Major 6
The last thing we can try is to move two non consecutive notes. We only get 2 non consecutive note options, C and Gb or Eb and A, so if we lower these we get a B7b5 chord which is the same as a F7b5 chord, as they are just an inversion of one another. 

This is because dominant flat 5 chords a tritone apart share the exact same notes. If we lower the other 2 notes, Eb and A, we get a D7b5 or an Ab7b5.

If we go back and raise the non consecutive notes, C and Gb, we get A7b5 or Eb7b5. If we raise the Eb and A, we get a C7b5 or a Gb7b5. 

Full Diminished Family
So to summarize, within this on diminished family we get:

C diminished Family
               - m3 -    - m3 -   - m3 -
           Co7	 Ebo7 	Gbo7 	Ao7 		(inversions)
           B7  	 D7     	F7    	 Ab7  		(dominant 7th chords from lower a single tone)
           Gbm6	 Am6 	Cm6 	Ebm7 		(4 minor 6th chords)
Co7 |   D6	 F6	Ab6	B6		(4 major 6th chords)
Tran|   A6	C6       	Eb6	Gb6		(4 major 6th chords)
           B7b5   D7b5  | F7b5    Ab7b5	    	(2+2 dominant flat 5 chords + 2+2 inversions)	
           A7b5   C7b5  | Eb7b5  Gb7b5

This also tells us why there are 4 scales:
Dominant 7th Diminished
Minor 6th Diminished
Major 6th Diminished
Dominant 7b5 Diminished

So this a big family of chords which all share and come from this one c diminished and so they are all related to one another. Within each chord quality the chords are a minor third apart and Barry calls these minor third relationships brothers and sisters. And what he likes to say is who do children play well with first? Their brother and their sister! Referencing that all these chords work well together to create movement. 


Moving From Brother to Sisters: M6 Chords
A common sound that Barry uses to demonstrate connecting these relationships is by moving from a C6 chord to a F6 chord, with a C7 in between.

C6: 	C   E   G   A
Co7:	C   Eb Gb A
F6:	C   B   F    G 

Really this is just a movement in F major, because C6 can be used as a voicing for F, as C6 over F is basically a F major 9 chord, which is basically just an F6 with borrowed notes. I'll get deeper into that later when we talk about some of the sixth chord options available to us and the borrowing concept.

So in drop 2 it sounds like this:

C6:	C   G   A   E        (C6 -> F9 “F6” w/ borrowed = F A C E G w/ drop 2, C in bass: C G A E 
Co7:	C   Gb A   Eb
F6:	C   F   A    D

This also sounds good when we take it through their inversions as well.

Drop 2 First Inversion:
C6:	E   A   C   G
Co7:	Eb A   C   Gb
F6:	D   A   C   F

Drop 2 Second Inversion:
C6: 	G   C   E   A
Co7:	Gb C   Eb A
F6:	F    C   D   A

Drop 2 Third Inversion:
C6:	A   E   G   C
Co7:	A   Eb Gb C
F6:	A   D   F   C

This move also exists for the brothers and sisters a minor third apart as well, (i think this might be an error? He says minor third apart, which I think is left to right, but it's actually from top to bottom, so I think he means minor 5 or major 5 apart instead?)

Co7 |   D6	 F6	Ab6	B6		(4 major 6th chords)
Tran|   A6	C6       	Eb6	Gb6		(4 major 6th chords)

Example:

Eb6:	Eb Bb C   G
Co7	Eb A   C   Gb
Ab6:	Eb Ab C   F

Gb6:	Eb Bb Db Gb
Co7:	Eb A   C   Gb
B6:	Eb Ab Cb Gb

A6:	E   A   C# F#
Co7:	Eb Ab C   Gb
D6:	D   A   B   F#

They are all using the same Co7 chord to connect to one another. And so connecting any combination of these chords using that diminished in between will work really nicely. For example, connecting Eb6 to B6.

Eb6:	Eb Bb C   G
Co7:	Eb A   C   Gb
B6:	Eb Ab Cb Gb

This works because all these major 6th chords come from the same diminished by either raising or lowering two consecutive notes. Hence, why they all share the same diminished chord. So by transitioning through the diminished chord, we are essentially reverting the changes, and jumping to somewhere else.

Moving From Brother to Sisters: IV to F (in key of F)
We can also do a similar move by moving from the four chord to the F with a diminished in between. So Bb6 to Bo7 to F6.

Bb6:	Bb D   F   G
Bo7:	B   D   F   Ab
F6:	C   D   F   A



And if we take it through its inversions

First Inversion:
Bb6:	D   G   Bb F
Bo7:	D   Ab B   F
F6:	D   A   C   F

Second Inversion:
Bb6:	F   Bb D   G
Bo7:	F   B   D   Ab
F6:      F   C   B   A

Third Inversion:
B6b:	G   D   F   Bb
Bo7:	Ab D   F   B
F6:	A   D   F   C

So this time the diminished which B flat 6 and F6 come from is the D diminished which inverted is just a Bo7.

           A7b5   C7b5  | Eb7b5  Gb7b5





Moving From Brother to Sisters: I to F (in key of C)
Heres another cool thing to spot, lets look at the C6 to F6 again but this time see C6 as the one chord. So this move is now using the I diminished to get from the I to the IV.

C6:	C   E   G   A
Co7:	C   Eb Gb B
F6:	C   D   F   A   (IV6)

F6 contains the same notes as a d minor 7 which in relation to C is also the two chord.

C6:	C   E   G   A
Co7:	C   Eb Gb A   (io7)
Dm7: 	C   D   F   A   (iim7)

We can also see the Io7 as the same as the biiio7 and say we are going from the I and using the biiio7 to resolve to the ii.

C6: 	C   E   G   A
Ebo7:	C   Eb Gb A   (biiio7)
Dm7:	C   D   F   A

And then even back through the biiio7 to resolve back to the I again so:

I6   biiio7   ii   biiio7   i6

A well known Barry quote is when he says why doesn’t anybody play flat 3 diminished anymore. What he might mean by this is that in jazz we;re so used to playing our ii V I and using the dominant V as our movement to I, that we forget about using the versatile flat three diminished which can resolve to either the one chord or the two chord. It can even resolve to the iii chord e m7 which is typically a sub for a I chord anyway.

Because e minor 7 is actually a g6 and a g6/C is c major 9. Again this will make more sense later on, but anyway we’ve managed to move from the I chord to the ii chord and back without ever needing to play a dominant V chord.

So you can apply this tension and release movement without being boxed in by the 251 terminology. For example, heres some movement from chord to chord without even using the dominant V chord, but instead thinking in diminished instead.

But Where Did The 6th Diminished Come From?
The reason we can lower and raise different diminished notes around to generate the families of those 4 different chord types, is because we are borrowing and mixing notes from two different diminished chords. So we look at C6, we got there by raising 2 consecutive notes up, from the C diminished.

Co7:	C   Eb Gb A
C6:	C   E   G   A

So this C6 now shares 50 percent of its dna from the C diminished and the Db diminished.

C6:	C   E   G   A		C dim: C A, 	Db dim: E G

Generating C6 Diminished Scale: C6 + (adding the missing diminished)
So now we know this C6 is made up of 2 different diminished chords, but what about the other diminished, the one we haven’t used, the Do7. We haven’t yet included that one so what we do is add it by putting the d diminished with the C6 and this is what creates the C Major 6 diminished scale and answers why we play through and move from C6 to Do7.

C6:	C   E   G   A		(1)
Do7:	D   F   Ab B		(2)
C6:	E   G   A   C		(3)
Do7:	F   Ab B   D		(4)
C6:	G   A   C   E 		(5)
Do7:	Ab B   D   F		(6)
C6:	A   C   E   G		(7)
Do7:	B   D   F   Ab		(8)





Applying to Other Chord Types: Filling in the Gaps C7 + (adding the missing diminished) 

We can experiment with this on the other chord types too, lets take C7, so the dominant chord type. 1 of the notes the C is from the C diminished and the other 3 notes come from the Db diminished

C7:	C   E   G   Bb
         - -      - - - - - - - 
|	|
          Co7   	Dbo7

Notice we are missing the D diminished, so we include the D diminished.

C7:	C   E   G    Bb		(1)
Do7:	D   F   Ab   B		(2)
C7:	E   G   Bb   C		(3)
etc.


Applying to Other Chord Types: Filling in the Gaps Cm6 + (adding the missing diminished) 

Cm6:	C   E   G   Bb
         - - - - -    - -    - - 
|	|        |
|      Dbo7     |
	|	         |
          Co7	       Co7

So again we would add the D diminished.

Cm6:	C   Eb G   A		(1)
Do7:	D   F   Ab B		(2)
Cm6:	Eb G   A   C		(3)
Etc…






Applying to Other Chord Types: Filling in the Gaps C7b5 + (adding the missing diminished) 

C7b5:	C   E   Gb  Bb
         - -    - -     - -    - - 
|     |	  |      |
|  Dbo7  |      Dbo7
	|	  |      
          Co7	Co7

So again we would add the D diminished.

C7b5:	C   E   Gb Bb		(1)
Do7:	D   F   Ab B		(2)
Cm6:	E   Gb Bb C		(3)
Etc…

Applying to Other Chord Types: Changing the Root + (adding the missing diminished) 

Lets change the root, lets take an F minor 6.

Fm6:	F   Ab  G    Db
         - - - - -    - -    - - 
|	|        |
|        Co7     |
	|	         |
          Do7	       Do7

So this time we add the Dbo7.

Fm6:	F   Ab C   B
Dbo7:	G   Bb Db E
Fm6:	Ab C   D   F
Etc…

4 Diminished Scales: The Where
This is where all 4 of these scales come from.
Major 6th diminished
Minor 6th diminished
Dominant 7th diminished
Dominant 7b5 diminished

This is all very theoretical, however once you get your head around this very logical concept, it will give you the ability to see al the relationships and it gives you a good insight into how Barry came ot the sixth diminished idea.

Once you can visualize all of these relationships and no longer need to think about theory, it will be very liberating and you’ll feel very free to add movement when improvising.

Applying The Scales 
The first thing we need to know when applying these scales is that Barry doesn’t think in minor 7 chords.

For example, if we see a Am7, it is really just a C6 with the sixth in the bass. As al the inversions of C6 are the same notes as A minor 7. 

This is the same for a Am7b5 chord, its really just a Cm6 with the sixth in the bass.

You’ve probably spotted this already when I was showing you some of the inversions of these chords. Barry adopted this way of thinking after he heard thelonious monk reference a minor 7b5 in this way.

So now, whenever we see a minor 7 chord, we think o it as just being an inversion of a major 6th chord, and when we see a minor 7b5 its just an inversion of a minor 6th chord.

Another important rule to know is that every dominant chord has what Barry calls an important minor. The important minor is found on the 5th degree of the dominant. So if you have a D7 the important minor would be the Am7. 

This is what we know as the ii V progression, however as I said before, Barry thinks in movement and not static ii V I, and remember we don’t think in m7 chords, so the ii chord is actually a C6, and so we use the C major 6th diminished scale, which leads into the V chord.

Heres a very basic way of what this can sound like. 

 Am7 (which is a C6) -> so we add CM6 diminished scale, which leads into the V chord.

You can also continue this sound over the V chord D7, as it creates a D7sus sound plus the diminished movements. However, as we know there are loads of other options which we can use for playing over the dominant V chord.

So as well as using Barry’s dominant 7th and dominant 7b5 diminished scales for creating movement and harmonizning melodies over dominant chords, a good one to also know is that we can again us e the important minor rule on D7. But this time think of the minor as an Am6, which allows us to use the Am6 diminished scale.

THe reason this works is for the same reason as before, both D7 and Am6 come from the same diminished chord, you just lower Eb to get to D7 or raise it to get to Am6.

We can also use this same concept to get a different sound on the dominant chord by using th eimportant minor rule on tritone sub of D7 = Ab7. In other words, we can use the m6 diminished on the 5th deg


Intro

Great! Now, we can go deep into the Barry Harris 6th diminished concept, and how we can use the amazing possibilities it gives us within our improvising.


What is the 6th Diminished Scale

The 6th diminished concept is all about seeing relationships between chords and creating harmonic and melodic movement when supporting a melody or playing through chord changes. 

Barry often refers to the modern day jazz student or musician as being ‘ii V’ players as in we tend to see chord changes as separate blocks which we read from a page. As opposed to seeing the relationships within a chord and the possible inner movements.

So first, lets look at what the major sixth diminished scale is. Its basically a major scale with an added flat 6 or sharp 5 interval creating a 8 note scale.. So in the key of C: C D E F G Ab A B. You might already be familiar with this set of notes if you’ve ever checked out any of the bebop scale concepts. As this is the same set of intervals which make up a major bebop scale. However, even though both scales share the same notes, you don't really want to want to think of the major 6th diminished scale as the same as the major bebop scale kjust because the bebop scale concept is purely about adding that Ab as a chromatic passing tone inr order to make the chord tones land on the downbeats.

Whereas in the 6th diminished scale, the Ab is an essential note which makes up the core sound of the scale when harmonized. So even though both concepts share the same scale, they are not the same purely because their functions are different. 

Another way of viewing this scale is by seeing it as being made up by a major sixth chord and a diminished chord. This is because when harmonizing the scale by stacking thirds to generate 4 note chords. Or by Barrys definition of constructing a chord, skip a note, skip a note, skip a note within the notes of a scale. If we do this all we get is a C6 and a Do7. Which alternate between their inversions. So if you harmonized each note of the scale yo uwould get the four inversions of C6 and then also the four inversions of Do7 which is an equivalent of an Do7, Fo7, Abo7, and Bo7, as they all share the exact same notes.

So for the purpose of this lesson, lets view the scale as being made up of a major 6th chord and a diminished chord build from the M7 degree of the scale. So C6 and Bo7. 

This also allows us to now see the diminished chord as being built from the third of the dominant of C, the dominant of C is the 5th which is G, and so the diminished chord is built from the B or third of G. So this also now tells us that when playing this harmonized scale it is technically cycling through a V I cadence because building a diminished chord off the third of the dominant gives you a dominant flat 5 chord. So we what are getting is a repeating C6 and G7 flat 9 chord sequence as we go through the harmonzied scale. Hence why the sound of each diminished inversion is wantin
