# Preface

## Intro
> Hello! all of these notes will be in short hand form, to avoid rewriting the textbook from scratch.
> Additionally, I am reading/writing this in my vscode, i know i know, editing text in vscode,
> an editor for code, WITH CODE IN THE NAME, disgraceful, buttt the rest of my LeetCode notes
> are here so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.
> As such, the notes look much prettier (and colored) in vscode, if you want to read along, 
> plz check my github! - jonathan

> Additionally, if this looks bad in full screen, that is because I
> only read the notes in 2/3rds split screen and I dont have the need 
> to fix it, again:  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.


## Composition in the age of computers
While computers today can produce precise pages of music in high quality, 
a well spaced hand copying or a composer's manuscript tells 
us more about the music than the impersonality of a computer set page can.

Thus, it is important that the musician sitting at a computer has to have on
hand regardless whether its necessary anymore, to write compositions by hand.

## Scope of this book
The information presented is relevant regardless of wether the user is sitting 
at a computer or copying a manuscript by hand, the language of notation providing
elegant layout allowing the musicians reading it to play at their most elegant.

## Historical Context
During the mid twentieth century, notation had been innovated and expanded throughout 
different parts of the world. This led to duplicated work, high adopted notation, 
and other notation that has not been found so useful. The text revisits notation in 
the light of scores written in the intervening years between mid twentieth and 
early twenty first.

The text is highly selective in the choice of extended instrumental and vocal techniques,
but is intended that by the end the reader should have the skills to create notation 
for other techniques not in common use.

Additionally, it is important to note the shift in music notation as a prescriptive 
vehicle, a set of instructions for the performer, but additionally as a descriptive 
vehicle, documenting sounds in the fields of electronic music and ethnomusicology.

## Scope of Text
The text is not a history of music notation, but a practical guide to present day
musicians who need to learn who to communicate their music accurately and effectively.



# I. General Conventions

## Ground Rules

### The Stave

#### Five Line Stave
The size of each note is measured in proportion to the stave size. 
A five line stave is used for instruments with definite pitch.

#### Single Line Stave
Compromised on a single line and used for: 
- notate instruments of indefinite pitch
- note percussive sounds
- notate vocal sounds of non specific pitch
- to notate a cue line of rhythm

### Clefs

#### Clef Position
There are four common clefs:

1. G Treble Clef 
2. F Bass Clef
3. C Clefs: soprano, mezzo soprano, alto, tenor, baritone
4. Percussion Clefs

All are indented into the stave by one stave space, or a little less.

#### Clefs To Use
For everything except for percussion, each stave must begin with a clef.

Among C clefs, only alto and tenor are common.
Among common orchestral instruments, only the viola uses the alto clef,
which should also be used for alto trombone parts.
Bassoon, trombone, cello, and sometimes double bass use the tenor clef.

#### Changing Clef
For any clef change after the beginning of the system, should be 
two-thirds the size of the clef at the beginning of the stave

Stay in one clef for as long as practicable, using up to at least 
three ledger lines rather than changing clef frequently. As the 
ledger lines show the contour of the pitches, which the clef change 
would hide.

##### At the Beginning of the System
Give warning of the clef change by placing the new clef at the end of 
the previous system before the bar line.

##### At the Beginning of a Bar
The clef always goes before the barline, whether or not resets precede 
the entry.

Clefs are only after barlines for cues and clef changes after repeat sections.

##### Mid Bar
Place new clefs between beats or after rests, rather than in the middle 
of notes or a beat.

##### Between Phrases
Between passages of continuous playing, place a new clef between phrases, 
which overrules the previous rules.

##### With Tied Notes
Avoid changing a clef during a tied note, as the tie will look cumbersome, but 
if it cannot be avoided, the clef is best changed at a system break.

##### After Periods of Rests
When an instrument rests for more than a system, it is usual to return it to its 
commonest clef. (Useful when reading a full score as a clef such as viola can 
help identify the stave immediately.) Place the clef change at the end of 
the system after the player has finished, rather than an immediate clef change
before rests, which draws unwanted attention to the new clef at an arbitrary point.
Or the reverse of changing from the usual clef to a new clef, retain the original 
clef until the barline before the next entry, which alerts the performer to the 
change at the relevant point.

### Note Heads

#### Shape and Size

##### Black Noteheads
These are oval shaped with a diagonal slant away from the stem.

##### White Noteheads

###### 
These are oval shaped with diagonal shading, usually slightly larger than
the black notehead.

### Stems 

### Tails

### Beams 

### Ledger Lines

### Octave Signs

### Using Ledger Lines or Octave Signs

### Rest symbols
