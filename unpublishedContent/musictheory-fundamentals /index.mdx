# Circle of 5ths -> 4 Half Circles

## Intro
The circle of 5ths for me is a bit confusing 
in its visual representation. I cant think or read 
counter clockwise flats as I can clockwise with sharps,
so I made this trick for me to be able to think faster.
Additionally this also helps with getting chords that 
are not displayed on the circle of fifths.

## Problem 1: Missing 6 notes/keys

If we put every note possible on a table, we get:
- A  B  C  D  E  F  G 
- Ab Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb
- A# B# C# D# E# F# G#

If we match this table with notes on the circle of fifths:
```js
                C       
       F _____________ G  
       /               \
  Bb /                   |  D 
    /                     \
   |                       |
Eb |                       | A 
   |                       |
    |                     | 
 Ab  |                   | E
      |                 /
    Db |______________  B  
   C#          F#       Cb
               Gb
```
We get:
- A  B  C  D  E  F  G 
- Ab Bb Cb Db Eb    Gb
-                F#   

With the circle of 5ths we are missing
these 6 notes:
- A  B  C  D  E  F  G 
-                Fb

How do we derive the missing notes?
We get this by the 4 half circles shown below


## Problem 2: Thinking About Flats Fast

The second problem is that I for the life of me cannot
read a circle counter clockwise as fast as I can clockwise.
Im guessing its because my brain has been wired to read 
right to left or just read a clock 1->12, just a small quirk.

How do we fix the slowness problem?
We can represent the 4 half circles all as clock wise
using the 4 right halves of a circle.

## Solution: 4 Right Half Circles

Start with the circle of fifths and split it in half.
```js
// Start with the right half of circle of 5ths
// then extend it
    C       
    ______ G  
          \
           |  D 
            \
             |
             | A 
             |
            | 
           | E
          /
    ______  B  
   F#           
```

Now, use the same shape for the original circle of fifths
```js
// 2 halves
    C              C              Cb              C#
    _____ G       ______ F        _____ Fb       _____  G#
          \              \              \              \
           |  D           | Bb           |              |  D#
            \              \             \               \
             |             |              |               |
             | A           | Eb            |              | A#
             |             |              |               |
            |             |              |               |
           | E           | Ab           |               | E#
          /             /              /               /
    ____  B       ______ Db         ____           ____ B#
   F#              Gb                               
```

And then lets add in the notes we were missing from problem 1:
- A  B  C  D  E  F  G 
-                Fb
```js
// 4 halves
    C              C              Cb              C#
    _____ G       ______ F        _____ Fb       _____  G#
          \              \              \              \
           |  D           | Bb           |              |  D#
            \              \             \               \
             |             |              |               |
             | A           | Eb            |              | A#
             |             |              |               |
            |             |              |               |
           | E           | Ab           |               | E#
          /             /              /               /
    ____  B       ______ Db         ____           ____ B#
   F#              Gb                               
```
Now we have a visual diagram of:
- How to derive all 21 notes, by modifying original notes/chords
on the circle (e.g., D -> D#, just sharp every note in the D chord
- We can traverse flats quicker by going by 4ths clockwise

# Major and Minor Scales

## Context: Major Scale
Derived from circle of fifths

- Major: Normal, no modifications

## Context: Minor Scale
Derived from circle of fifths + modified for compositional purposes 
for harmonic/melodic.

Minor just means that the scale has a minor three instead of a major
three. This means all scales with a minor 3 are minor, like Dorian,
Phrygian, Klezmer, etc. The 3 is the third most important note in a 
scale, the first being the 1 and the second being the 5. If the 5 is 
altered the scale basically can never resolve, since you can't resolve 
to a diminished or augmented chord, unless we were aliens. So there 
are technically countably infinite minor scales.
 
- Natural: Normal, no modifications, represents 'normal' minor sound
- Harmonic: 7# raised so we get Major V, for V - i cadences
- Melodic:  6# raised to avoid awkwardness of second interval between 
6b and 7 scale degree, this instead makes it a whole step between 
6b and 7. This is one reason why b6 -> 7 sounds kind of awkward in
melodies as the b6 wants to resolve down to 5, whereas the 7 
wants to resolve up to the tonic. Thus b6 and 7 pull in opposite 
directions, and the distance between them is quite big. These are 
the most strongly directional notes in the minor key. This is also why 
you don't really  want to raise the 6th if you aren't continuing to 
the leading tone. The raised 6th lacks the pull towards the 5th that 
the b6 degree has. And the b6 -> 5 resolution is pretty much the most
characteristic resolution of the minor key. This is also why we revert 
the 6th to original on the way down from melodic minor to natural minor
to get back that pull from b6 -> 5 on the way down, since we don't need
to the pull to the tonic anymore.

## Major Scale
```js
                   I  ii iii IV V  vi viio
      Major Scale: 1  2  3   4  5  6  7
```

## Minor Scales
```js

      Minor Scale: 1  2   3    4   5  6   7      --------------
      (natural) 

                   i  iio III+ iv  V  VI  vii    7# modi
      Minor Scale: 1  2   3    4   5  6   7      --------------
      (harmonic)                                 III  -> III+
                                                 v    -> V
                                                 VII  -> vii
    
                   i  ii  III+ IV  V  vi  vii    6# modi
    C Minor Scale: 1  2   3    4   5  6   7      --------------
    (Melodic Up)                                 iio  -> ii
                                                 iv   -> IV
                                                 VI  -> vi
```

# Key Changes

## Intro: Learning By Example
Most sources that provide info regarding key changes
have not been helpful, so im just going to do it by example 
and sort songs by types of key change to see if we can find 
recurring patterns and such

## Major: 7b -> 4 Scale Degree

### Hey Jude

### The Long and Winding Road

### Love of my Life

# The ~144 Chords

## Intro
So we've been talking about chords in the previous sections,
but how do we know what note goes where? 
Brute force memorization seems to be the answer when starting 
something new so we're going to write out every possible combination 
of 'beginner' chords and sort the chords into a derivation shortcut 
similar to the circle of fifths. 

We will leave major, augment, minor, and diminished triads
as the parents, and from there derive the children permutations
forming a graph structure to remember quicker.

## Major Triad -> Seventh + Aug -> Seventh ::6+1::

// determines its type). The sus replaces the third with another note
// (usually the 2nd or 4th), leading to the eventual resolving to
// the third to be satisfying.

// Sus extensions (past 7th) are usually dominant (minor) with a 7b,
// as dominant 7ths are the most harmonically unstable and want resolution,
// so this adds color before resolving. Aug, major, dim sus is possible 
// but again less common

// diminished sus 7bb is just a 6, so we count that as a 6th chord
// aug sus 7# is just a 1, so we count that as a triad
