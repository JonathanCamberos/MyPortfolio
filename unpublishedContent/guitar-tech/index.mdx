## Changing Strings

Notes from Frudua's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo5i2wkXaoY 

Set your guitar flat on a table, with some object below the neck
supporting it in place, specifically towards the end of the neck near 
below the nut.

This is so that gravity pulls evenly on all strings towards the fretboard, as
oppose if you were holding the guitar, gravity would be pulling all the strings
parallel to the fretboard.

Tools Needed: 
1. Tuner
2. Pincer to cut strings
3. String Winder
4. New set of strings

Steps:

1. Remove high E string

So, start by de tuning the first string and cut it. Take the new string,
insert it in the 10-piece hole, go over the bridge, and place it on the nut. 

2. Insert String Into Post

Then align the slot where you are going to insert the string, where is inside the
post. Twist the post to be parallel and straight with the string.

3. Wrap New String Around Post

Now that we align the slot of the post with the string, we have to wrap the string
around the post. Now, it would be good to follow the video here for imagery.

First of all, notice how I am putting constant tension on the string while leaving
some gap here with the rest of the fingers. Pushing the index finger down to lock 
the string.

Then we turn the end of the string towards the headstock direction and under the
portion of strings going from tuning gear post to the nut. Learn this by heart, so
inside and under. 

Now then, by firmly holding the string again with the index finger, make a strong wrap 
under the string and bend it inwards again and make a sharp angle over the string
towards the center of the headstock. 

Then use your string winder and start turning the peg away from the center
while holding the sharp angle.

The string should start to wrap under itself. Once you are complete, cut the extra string
and repeat.

4. Repeat for other 5 strings.

5. How Many Wraps Around Post Per String

Now considering that each string has a different diameter, you might ask yourself, how
many wraps do I need around the post?

- Low E: 3 to 4 wraps
- A: 3 to 4 wraps
- D: 4 to 5 wraps
- G: 5 wraps
- B: 5 wraps
- High E: 6 wraps  

6. Tuning the Guitar

Note: 
Tremolos and Fixed Bridges must be handled in totally different ways.

This mix of mounting and tuning, will make our normal tuning gears
behave like locking ones.

If you have a floating tremolo please watch the other video, how
to keep your stratocaster tremolo in tune.

## Truss Rod Adjustment

Frudua vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_qZ_QGXI4w

Information on how to adjust truss rod. When you change the strings, change the tuning,
etc. To learn how to adjust the truss rod to get the comfort you need.

There are 2 main things, that he brings up that are not well known regarding 
the adjustment, regarding comfort and action on your guitar.

1. Neck Relief

The neck relief, which is adjusted through the truss rod, is much more 
important for your comfort on the instrument than the height of the saddles,
bridge, and strings.

2. Instrument Feel Changing Over Night, Don't Touch The Bridge

The only thing that can move on its own, on your guitar or bass, is the neck. Because
the neck is made of wood, and wood is an 'alive' material. And it moves, according to 
whether its cold or hot, the moisture, weather, etc.

So what does that mean in practice? If you find yourself that you wake up in the 
morning and want to practice your guitar or bass, and the action does not feel like 
it was the day before. Do not touch the bridge saddle.

Because you didn't touch it. You didn't wake up in the night (pretends to sleep walk) and
touch the bridge saddle.

This tutorial will show you how to adjust that with truss rod adjustment.

How to Adjust:

Now for your neck and action to feel comfortable, and so you don't experience
any kind of buzz of the fretboard, the neck needs a slight up bow.

```
A vibrating string:

                        12th fret
                          |
                _______________________
            __/                       \__
Head    ___/                             \___  Bridge
Stock   -------------------------------------  Saddle 
        ‾‾‾\                             /‾‾‾
            ‾‾\_______________________/‾‾
```

If you check the vibration of the strings, while it is vibrating, it forms
an ellipse and elliptical pattern which is block at both sides and has its 
max width at the middle of the string, which on the guitar corresponds to
the 12th fret

Now lets draw the guitar under the string.


```
A string vibrating over fretboard, over part of guitar body, and
held in place by head stock to the bridge saddle.


                        12th fret
                          |                    Guitar Body
               _________________   Bridge    / - - - - - /
            __/                 \__  Saddle /           /
Head    ___/                        \___   /           /
Stock   -------------------------------   /           /
  = = = ‾‾‾\                        /‾‾‾ /           /
  | |   = = ‾‾\_________________/‾‾‾    /           /
              = = = = = = =            /           /
     Bridge     Fret Board  = = = = = / - - - - - /      


```

Now, you'll see that the fretboard is running through a large portion of
the string and vibration of the string, but the string goes from the entire 
head stock to the bridge. 

Now if you have too much of a straight fretboard, a straight neck. You will
experience some buzz on this portion of the neck.

```
A string vibrating over fretboard, over part of guitar body, and
held in place by head stock to the bridge saddle.


                        12th fret
                          |                    Guitar Body
               _________________   Bridge    / - - - - - /
            __/                 \__  Saddle /           /
Head    ___/                        \___   /           /
Stock   -------------------------------   /           /
  = = = ‾‾‾\ = = =                  /‾‾‾ /           /
  | |       ‾‾\___= = =_________/‾‾‾    /           /
                        = = =          /           /
     Bridge     Fret Board    = = = = / - - - - - /      
     
                                                
```

The video has a better diagram!

So we know that the strings are in tension. And when we tune them, and they weight
a lot, so they tend to bend the fretboard and make the lower half of the ellipse
harsher.

The truss rod is a device that allows you to counteract the movement of the neck
and correct it.

So how the truss rod works is very simple, no mystery. So there is a nut where you
can put a hex key or screwdriver.

- If you turn it clockwise, you create a back bow, so the upper side of the ellipse
- If you turn it counterclockwise, you create a front bow, so the lower side of the ellipse

Now you are probably thinking, I don't want to touch the truss rod. I don't want to make
adjustments because I fear I might damage the guitar.

So let me tell you what, you can only damage the truss rod if the truss rod is already 
damaged. If the guitar is new and is ok, you can easily perform a truss rod adjustment. And
this is because every guitar is made in a way that you can only make very small adjustments 
per rotation. You can make a whole turn, and you can stop if you feel if the truss rod 
is getting hard to turn. In this case take it to the guitar doctor. 

Now how to adjust the truss rod.

1. Put A Guitar Capo On Fret 1

2. Put A Finger Across At The Last Fret Of High E String

3. Check Relief of Neck 

Note:
Always do this with the instrument in vertical position.

Now, between 1. and 2. you are using the high E string as a straight line to check the 
relief of the neck.

You do this by tapping on the 10th fret.

- Good Relief

Now, in the video he shows what a good relief and truss rod action set up looks like 
by demonstrating the tapping at the 10th fret being reasonable. Again,
look at the video to get this hand wavey example. 

- Too Much BackBow (lower ellipse)

This is a neck with too much of a back bow. When tapping you see there is almost
no movement on the 10th fret

- Too Much UpBow (upper ellipse)

You see that the distance is higher than before.

Now don't worry about the hand wavey, we have real life examples and reference to measure 
the tapping distance at the 10th fret, to be sure of what you are doing on the truss rod.

So train your eye for the tapping distance, but in the meantime, here are some 
examples using daily objects.

1. Piece of Paper/Envelope Cutout 

Take the piece of dario envelop, always having the capo on the first fret, keep the last fret 
pressed with your finger. And put the dario envelop under the string under the 10th fret 
and notice what happens at the 11th fret.

When I put the paper under the 10th fret, nothing happens at the 11th fret, which means that
the paper perfectly matches the space under the string and the 10th fret.

As I set up the truss rod of this neck for a comfortable action for chords and solos, this 
gives you an exact reference you can use.

2. Business Card

Now what happens if I use my business card? Keep in mind mainly all business cards are the
same thickness. If I put the card under the string at the 10th fret, notice that the string 
at the 11th fret rises. So this is too much.


Note: for the cards, on a bass you can start on the thickness of a business card
and go up to the thickness of a credit card for harder touch especially if you are 
a rock player. 

Some guitars react differently to truss rod adjustments. Some react immediately, some an
hour, and some a day. It depends on the stiffness of the neck the wood is made of etc. 

There is a little trick to sometimes reduce and even avoid this problem.  

Another important thing, always check for truss rod relief as we have done with the guitar 
in playing position or vertical position. Never check for truss rod alignment in horizontal 
position because gravity will increase the up bow and you will be able to have a real perception 
of how the situation is on the neck.

So to resume. No matter what touch you have, no matter the strings you are using, the neck 
must have a light relief.

If you find something different on your guitar one day or another and you haven't touched 
anything on the guitar. Don't touch the bridge. Do what we have done in this video and it 
will get back to whatever it was before.

## Guitar Intonation 

Frudua video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6dlN93MGgw

Tutorial on intonation.

Intonation is important for having a tuned guitar on the whole fretboard and also important 
for the tone. If you have strings and notes that are not tuned correctly on the whole fret 
board
