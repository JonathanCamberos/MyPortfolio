# Practice: Hearing Solfege 11/08/24
Pg 1-5

To internalize solfege in my ear, and to start recognizing
major and minor 3rds, I started running through these exercises:

```python
Sing Solfege from root to third of chord, and at the same time
hear the in between note in your ear, but do not sing, so: 

() = silent
do (re) mi, re (mi) fa, mi (fa) sol, sol (la) ti

  m3              M3            m3
     - - - - v     - - - - v     - - - - v
    |       re    |       mi    |       fa
    |   do   |    |   re   |    |   mi   |
    ti       |    do       |    re       |
    ^ - - - -     ^ - - - -     ^ - - - - 
       viio           I             ii 

  m3              M3            M3
     - - - - v     - - - - v     - - - - v
    |       sol   |       la    |       ti
    |   fa   |    |   sol  |    |   la   |
    mi       |    fa       |    sol      |
    ^ - - - -     ^ - - - -     ^ - - - - 
        iii           IV             V 

  m3              
     - - - - v    
    |       re  
    |   do   | 
    ti       |  
    ^ - - - -    
       vii    

```

Retrospective:
Good exercise to start 'hearing' notes without singing notes, so the 
ghost notes here help stretch the ear to hear notes in songs without 
actually needed to sing them back to check your work


# Patterns: Hearing and Singing Intervals
Pg 6-7

Extending on recognizing m3 vs M3 intervals, I started running through
these exercises to recognize intervals:

```python
Going Up:

  m2  -> Jaws, Isnt She Lovely,             Mi -> Fa, Ti -> Do (half step)
  M2  -> Happy Birthday, Frere Jaque,       Do -> Re, Sol -> La (Whole Step) 
  m3  -> Brahams Lullaby, Jingle Bells,     Do -> Me, Sol -> Li (W + H)
  M3  -> Major Appregio,                    Do -> Mi (2*W)
  P4  -> Wedding Song, Amazing Grace,       Do -> Fa (2*W + H)
  Tri -> Simpsons, Up P5 down half,         Do -> Fi (2*W + H) + (H)
  P5  -> Twinkle Little Star, Star Wars,    Do -> Sol (2*W + H) + (W)
  m6  -> Entertainer,                       Do -> Si (2*W + H) + (W + H)
  M6  -> My Bonnie, Dashing Through Snow,   Do ->
  m7  -> Dominant 7                         
  M7  -> Take On My, Dont Know Why          
  P8. -> Over the Rainbow, HaiHo Snow White Do -> Do, Sol -> Sol

Going Down:


```

Retrospective:
This is good to get introduced to using your ear like a muscle, but 
eventually it is much more effective to jump around using the major 
scale as reference, and modify intervals as needed.


# Patterns: Augmented and Diminished
Pg 8-11

Wrapping my head around diminished chords. Drew a few diagrams:

```python
Dim Below the Two:  Li/Te Di/Ra Mi Sol

        sol    sol
        mi     mi
        do  -> di
            -> li
        I           

Dim Above the Two:  Do Ri/Me Fi/Se La

        sol    se
        mi     me 
        do     do
            -> la
        I         

Dim on the Two:     Ti Re Fa Si/Le

        sol    fa
        mi     re
        do  -> ti
            -> si 
```

Retrospective:
Found the correct pattern and shortcut of Si/Le, Fi/Se etc. but 
did not make the 'why' connection as to why diminished chords exist.

Notice where 2 of the diminished come from.

1. Dim Below the Two:  Li/Te Di/Ra Mi Sol

If we take the middle half step solfeges, we have ti and do, and 
if you notice, if we simple take a half step away from each other
we get te and di, our modified notes. So:

Ti Do Mi Sol -> Te Di Mi Sol

2. Dim Above the Two:  Do Ri/Me Fi/Se La

We can do the same take the middle half step solfeges, mi and fi, and
do the half step away from each other trick to get me and fi. So:

La Do Mi Fa -> La Do Me Fi

3. Dim on the Two:     Ti Re Fa Si/Le

This one is special because there is only 1 modified note, so here
it servers more so as a pyramid to build around it. So:

Ti Re Fa La -> Ti Re Fa Si/Le Ti Re Fa 

- TLDR: Diminished chords come from the half step solfege TiDo, MiFa, and Sol

# Pattern: Triad Any Chord Shifting By Steps and Shared Notes
Pg 12-17
Realized the triad shifting from book II that was used on the I chord
can be used for any chord while keeping the interval in mind. So:

Triad transition for I -> IV also works for ii -> V

# Practice: Major Key Memorization
Pg 18-21

Repetition writing out major scales

# Pattern: Abstracting and Playing All Keys 
Pg 22-23

If we have the major key memorized, and the chords by solfege memorized,
we don't actually need to care about chords or what notes go where because
we can derive it on the fly. So:

```JS
    D Major: D E F# G A B C# D

    I: 1 3 5 -> D F# A 
    IV: 4 6 1 -> G B A
```

So we just need to memorize:
```python

    IV:   4 6 1
    V:    5 7 2
    vi:   6 1 3
    viio: 7 2 4
    I:    1 3 5 
    ii:   2 4 6
    iii:  3 5 7

```

Retrospective:
Correct, this is how I know my chords now. Its sort of a backwards 
approach, but this ended up working better than just memorizing
7*12 chords each with random letters in a random order. And even better 
since I'm deriving  it every time a play a chord its a speed exercise helping
my brain go faster each time I play a chord in a song which just helps
solidify it in memory. But doing the 'why' each time helps.

# Practice: Inner Ear, Harmony and Extensions
Pg 24-25

Did a few exercises to engrain sounds ear during the beginning.

Harmony Exercise:
1. Sing Note (e.g., C)
2. Hear Ghost Note Harmony, then Sing Solfege (e.g., E, G)
3. Play Harmony on Instrument
4. Repeat...


Extension Exercise:
1. Sing Note (e.g., C)
2. Hear Ghost Note Harmony, then Sing Triad (e.g., E)
3. Play on Instrument
4. Sing Note (e.g., E)
5. Repeat Step 2
6. Continue in Triads until you hit original C again (e.g. E G B D F A C)


Retrospective:
Good exercise, ran into issue while playing The Long and Winding Road 
on Paul's improve on the piano melody he does a run from:
Do Ti Sol Mi Do La, where the extension exercise backwards occurs on the
Sol Mi Do La.

# Practice: Minor Keys 
Pg 27-29

Wrote out rules for minor keys again

# Practice: Triads
Pg 30-33

Wrote out solfege triads to get ingrained in head.

# Practice: Bass Ear Training, Daniel Elton John
Pg 34-39

# Pattern: Chromatic Passing Chord, Still Crazy After All These Years
Pg 40

Example: Key G: Em -> (D#m) -> Dm

# Pattern: Secondary Dominant, V of the (), V7 of the ()
Pg 41 

Example: Key C: C -> (C7) -> F 

Here C7 has C E G Bb, and 2 things make this lean towards F.
1. C is the V of F
2. Bb is the Fa of F, and Fa is one way to switch keys


# Pattern: IV-iv-I
Pg 42

Popular voice leading allow for:

```python
    Chromatic Line:  La -> Le -> Sol
    Usual Step Wise: Fa -> Mi
    Shared Tone:     Do -> Do

        Do  Do  Sol
        La  Le  Mi
        Fa  Fa  Do
        IV  iv  I
```

# Pattern: Backdoor Progression, bVII7 -> IMaj7
Pg 43

Chord Progression: bVII7 -> IMaj7

Derived from minor iv chord and has similar voice leading. In C, 
we would start from F-Fm-C, Fm being the common borrowed chord to 
provide the chromatic line A-Ab-G, along with the usual F-E and the C 
shared tone.

It's common to add a 6th to the minor iv, F Ab C D. If we extend backwards
from that added 6th, we get Bb as the bass note, Bb9, Bb D F Ab C. This 
allows for a 3 way parallel descent from Fm triad with contrary motion 
in the bass:

```python
  C        C
  Ab  \    B
  F   \    G
  D   \    E
  Bb  /    C
 bVII7   Imaj7
```

We can also add the 13th to the minor iv, G, which would be a shared
tone with Cmaj7



# Practice: IV -> I, iv -> I
Pg 44-45

Writing out solfege/notes.

# Pattern: I-IV-V-I
Pg 46

Why this is the most common progression:
1. I IV V help establish the key as major
2. The entire scale is contained between the 3 chords, providing variety to the ear
3. Major chords sound stronger and more positive

# Practice: 7 ways to harmonize a Major Scale 
Pg. 47-49

Exercise from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAkJJQPV_xQ

0. Play the scale up and down:

```python
    
    Going Up:
        do  re  mi  fa  sol  la  ti  do

    Going Down:
        do  ti  la  sol  fa  mi  re  do
```

1. Fundamental I IV V

```python

    Going Up:
        do  re  mi  fa  sol  la  ti  do
        I   V   I   IV  I    IV  V   I

    Going Down:
        do, ti, la, sol, fa, mi, re, do
        I   V   IV  I    IV  I   V   I
```

2. Added Dominants I IV V -> I7, II7, IV7, V7
```python

    Going Up:
        do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do
        I   V7  I7  IV  I    II7 V7  I

    Going Down:
        do, ti, la, sol, fa, mi, re, do
        I   V   IV  I7   IV  II7 V7  I

```

3. Contrary Motion 1 
```js

    Going Up:
        do  re    mi      fa    sol   la       ti    do
        I   V7/ii I7/iib  F F-  I/vi  IV#-7b5  V/IV  I 

    Going Down:
        do  ti  la     sol  fa  mi      re   do
        I   V   #IIo7  I    IV  #IV-7b5. V7  I

```
