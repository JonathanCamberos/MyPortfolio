## 7 Scale 'Dominant 7 Scale'

All in Eighth Notes, remember we play jazz in eight notes.

```python

    Up:   | Do  Re  Mi  Fa | Sol La  Te  -  | 
            1   e   +   a    2   e   +   a

    Down: | Te  Le  Sol Fa | Mi  Re  Do  -  | 
            1   e   +   a    2   e   +   a

    Up and Down: | Do  Re  Mi  Fa | Sol La  Te  La | 
                 | Sol Fa  Mi  Re | Do  -   -   -  |
                   1   e   +   a    2   e   +   a 

```

Ex: Bb Major Scale Up and Down 
```python

    Bb Up and Down: | Bb  C   D   Eb | F   G   Ab  G  |
                    | Do  Re  Mi  Fa | Sol La  Te  La | 

                    | F   Eb  D   C  | Bb  -   -   -  | 
                    | Sol Fa  Mi  Re | Do  -   -   -  |
                      1   e   +   a    2   e   +   a 

```


Extending: Bb Major Scale Up and Down to the third of the G (B)
```python

    Bb Up and Down: | Bb  C   D   Eb | F   G   Ab  G  |
                    | Do  Re  Mi  Fa | Sol La  Te  La | 

                    | F   Eb  D   C  | B   -   -   -  | 
                    | Sol Fa  Mi  Re | Di  -   -   -  |
                      1   e   +   a    2   e   +   a 

```

Extending: Bb Major Scale Up and Down to the third of the G (B)
           up a diminished (B D F Ab) and down to the second of F (G),
           diminished below half step below the second.
```python

    Bb Up and Down: | Bb  C   D   Eb | F   G   Ab  G  |
                    | Do  Re  Mi  Fa | Sol La  Te  La | 

                    | F   Eb  D   C  | B   D   F   Ab | 
                    | Sol Fa  Mi  Re | Di  Mi  Sol Te |

                    | G   -   -   -  | -   -   -   -  | 
                    | La  -   -   -  | -   -   -   -  |
                      1   e   +   a    2   e   +   a

```python
                      1              
    Bb Up and Down: | -   -   -   -  | -   -   -   -  | 
                      2                
                    | -   -   -   -  | -   -   -   -  |

                      1   e   +   a    2   e   +   a 

```


Notes:
Barry: "Thats using 1 diminished that takes you to the 2, even though there 
is no such thing as 2, but imma have to say 2 cause you horn players
need some kind of harmony, but I dont believe in 2's, there is no 2."

"But theres another diminished that will take you to the 2, now thats the
diminished above the 2, thats the diminished a half step below the 2. 
Di Ba Da Bi Da -> (Di Mi Sol Te La), (La being 2 4 6 in 2)"

"Theres a diminished a half step above the 2 that will take you to the 2. Now
well think of something to do (does weird hand descending thing in head). Now
lets run this:
Tonic of Bb up, down to the 4 (Eb), after you get to the 4 grab the 
E concert (E), which is a half step above the 4, and come down that 
diminished (Fi, Me Do La)."

```python

    |  Ba  ba  di  buh |  di  buh di  buh  |
    |  Do  Re  Mi  Fa  |  Sol La  Te  La   |

    |  di  buh de  ba  |  Ba  de  de  be   |
    |  Sol Fa  Fi  Me  |  Do  La  Fi  Fa   |

```

Extending: Bb Major Scale Up and Down to the four, up a half step (E),
           below the diminished (Fi Me Do La),
           diminished below half step above the second.

```python

    Bb Up and Down: | Bb  C   D   Eb | F   G   Ab  G  |
                    | Do  Re  Mi  Fa | Sol La  Te  La | 

                    | F   Eb  E   Db | Bb  G   E   Eb | 
                    | Sol Fa  Fi  Me | Do  La  Fi  Fa |
                      1   e   +   a    2   e   +   a 

```

Extending: Chorus of the Blues, play the first one we played in the 
           right place, then a Chorus, and play the second one we played
           in the right place (7th, 8th, and 1 beat of 9th, then 7th, 8th bar).

```python
    Bb Up and Down    1              
    Below the 2:    | -   -   -   -  | -   -   -   -  |

Note:
"Now horn players understand this, you don't even care what the rhythm 
section is playing on the blues, you can play either one of 
those anytime you feel like, anytime you feel like, it doesn't matter. Now
to show you the difference between these two things"
