# Intro
> Hello! welcome to my personal notes, book 2. 
> Main intro to these notes is in book 1 intro. 

# Chromatic Scale: Outlining Diminished Scales
Pg 1-4

```python
---------------------------------------
1. Above the 2 -> 6 1 2/3 4/5

        2/3      4/5
#        #        #         #        #
do di re ri mi fa fi sol si la li ti do
do ra re me mi fa se sol le la te ti do
---------------------------------------
2. Below the 2 -> 3 5 6/7 1/2

  1/2                         6/7
   #        #        #         #   
do di re ri mi fa fi sol si la li ti do
do ra re me mi fa se sol le la te ti do
---------------------------------------
3. On the 2 -> 7 2 4 5/6

                        5/6
      #        #         #        # 
do di re ri mi fa fi sol si la li ti do
do ra re me mi fa se sol le la te ti do
---------------------------------------     

p.s. if each chromatic is assigned 1-12, then diminished 
chord formula is (3+1) mod 13 = next note
```

# Pattern: Explaining the B shift + 1
Pg. 20-23

Each string on the guitar is a forth or fifth away from each other.
Which is why we can go from string 5 -> string 6 on the same fret
to get sol, or go from string 5 -> string 4 on the same fret to get
fa. But why is this like this? Here is a verbal explanation, my book/notes
have a more visual one which makes more sense.


Imagine this pattern going down a single fret across the strings,
which extra strings to explain the pattern, but just pay attention to 
strings 1-6 which the actual guitar has: 

```python 
w/o B half step shift

Key of C, open strings:
string etc: ... 

string 0: te 
string 1: fa
string 2: do
string 3: sol
string 4: re 
string 5: la
string 6: mi
```

Notice that without the B half step shift, we don't get an octave 
on string 1/6. Now lets add the B half step shift back in:

```python
w/ B half step shift

Key of C, open strings:
string etc: ... 

string 0: la
string 1: mi
string 2: ti
string 3: fi 
string 4: re
string 5: la
string 6: mi
```

With the B half step shift, we can get that nice octave which allows 
use to do bar chords and the nice basic A major, E major, G major, D major
chords that we know and love.

p.s. The B half step interrupts the going up by 4ths, which should be
an infinite sequence.

```python
--2-- ------5-------  ------5------- --2-- ------5---
ti mi la re sol do fa li ri si di fi ti mi la re ... 
1  2  3  4  5   6  7  8  9  10 11 12 1  2  3  4  ...
```

tldr: there is a B shift to allow use to play guitar easier.


# Pattern: Guitar Intervals
Pg 24-27

As oppose to piano which is horizontal, guitar also has a vertical
aspect. This allows us to have some shortcuts to find intervals.

Ex: Do -> Sol
Pick a fret, and go 1 string higher on the same fret.
Do String 3, Fret 2 -> Sol String 4, Fret 2

These intervals are actually constant for all solfege. So all Do 
have Sol under, all Sol have a Re under, etc.

The B string half step does shift these intervals by 1, but thats
the only change.

Retrospective:
While this is helpful, what this actually allows us to do is use 
guitar as a solfege instrument instead of thinking of notes. We can
take any note and quickly go Do -> Sol, Sol -> Re, Fa -> La, etc.

# Pattern: Guitar Octave Patterns
Pg 28-35

There are 4 main guitar octave patterns we can use. To explain why
they exist imagine a point on a graph.

```python

    * 

```

This represents a guitar fret. Now, this note can have octaves spanning
in 4 directions. Up left, Up right, Down left, Down right.

```python
   < - >
     |
     *
     |
   < - >
```

Now, with this it would seem we have 4 octave patterns, however 
we actually only care about the diagonals. So we are going up right,
the pattern for this is 2 up, 2 right. But if we were going in the 
reverse diagonal direction, we get 2 down 2 left. So here they are
duplicates of each other and octaves of the same note. So our diagram
should look like this.

```python
Left Diagonal and Right Diagonal.

 \     /
  \   /
    * 
  /  \ 
 /    \
```

These 2 are easy to remember:

1. Left Diagonal: C chord pattern (3 down, 2 right) or reverse (3 up, 2 left)
2. Right Diagonal: 2 step pattern (2 up, 2 right) or reverse (2 down, 2 left)

Now remember we have the B string half step shift we have to take 
into account, so whenever a diagonal octave crosses this imaginary
boundary, we have to modify the horizontal.

1. Left Diagonal Modi: C chord pattern (3 down, 2 right) or reverse (3 up, 2 left)
2. Right Diagonal Modi: D chord pattern (3 down, 4 left)



# Pattern: Mapping Out Entire FretBoard
Pg 36-69

Since octaves have rules, I tried to make the jump that the board
itself must have rules. I tried to use different methods to attempt 
to map out the fret board.

Retrospective:
I was going about this the wrong way. While I knew the rules
existed, it would make sense to just extend that to the rest of the
board, they were too slow to use on the fly. A few months later
I revisited this and made the 5 hieroglyphs shortcut which is just 
my way of mapping out the board in a quick manner. Probably somewhere
in book 4 or 5.

# Pattern: Triad I Chord Shifting By Steps and Shared Notes
Pg 70

Lets start with the 7 basic major chords I ii iii IV V vi viio.

If you haven't had a good teacher or slow like me, when 
learning piano or guitar its easy to separate these chords as complete
different from one another. 

An obvious example is when playing a 4 chord progression, say I IV V I, one 
would play with each chord having its corresponding root note, do fa sol do, 
and while this is correct technically, it leads to a lot of unnecessary
and wasted hand movement and energy. 

A good example is you could play this 4 chord progression without moving
you hand. Play the I chord, and just shift the upper to fingers by a step, 
so 1 3 5 -> 1 4 6.

This lead me to realizing why we have chord inversions.
1. Save hand energy
2. Allows Variation in matching Progressions, for Bass Notes
3. Allows Variation in matching Progressions, for Melody
4. Allows Variation in matching Progression for Comping

```python

    5  6  7  1  2  3  4
    3  4  5  6  7  1  2 
    1  2  3  4  5  6  7
    I ii iii IV V vi viio

Distance of 1 shift:
    +------------------------+
    | 5    5    |  5 /  6    |
    | 3    3    |  3    3    |
    | 1 /  7    |  1    1    |
    | I -> iii  |  I -> vi   |
    +------------------------+

Distance of 2 shifts:
    +------------------------+
    | 5 /  6    |  5    5    |
    | 3 /  4    |  3 /  2    | 
    | 1    1    |  1 /  7    | 
    | I -> IV   |  I -> V    |
    +------------------------+

Distance of 3 Shifts:

    +------------------------+
    | 5 /  6    |  5 /  4    |
    | 3 /  4    |  3 /  2    |
    | 1 /  2    |  1 /  7    |
    | I -> ii   |  I -> viio |
    +------------------------+
```


# Pattern: Seventh I Chord Shifting By Steps and Shared Notes
Pg 71

We can expand the previous pattern to 7th chords.

Note: there are more possible combinations, but this is just 
to show as an example that chords to quite literally, next 
to each other 'just a step away'.

```python
    7  1  2  3  4  5  6  
    5  6  7  1  2  3  4
    3  4  5  6  7  1  2 
    1  2  3  4  5  6  7
    I ii iii IV V vi viio

Distance of 1 shift:
    +------------------------+
    | 7    7    |  7 /  6    |
    | 5    5    |  5    5    |
    | 3    3    |  3    3    |
    | 1 /  2    |  1    1    |
    | I -> iii  |  I -> vi   |
    +------------------------+

Distance of 2 shifts:
    +------------------------+
    | 7 /  6    |  7    7    |
    | 5 /  4    |  5    5    |
    | 3    3    |  3 /  4    | 
    | 1    1    |  1 /  2    | 
    | I -> IV   |  I -> V    |
    +------------------------+

Distance of 3 Shifts:

    +------------------------+
    | 7 /  6    |  7    7    |
    | 5 /  4    |  5 /  6    |
    | 3 /  2    |  3 /  4    |
    | 1    1    |  1 /  2    |
    | I -> ii   |  I -> viio |
    +------------------------+
```
