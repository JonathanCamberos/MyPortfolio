# Intro

> Hello! welcome to my personal notes, book 1. 
> After moving to Denver temporarily, I spent last fall/winter relearning
> music theory and have the notes handwritten in manuscript books. I 
> took the summer off to focus on getting 'interview ready' for a potential 
> job search, so now that its fall I thought it would be good review to 
> transcribe all of my notes to mdx so save it and reorganize it for 
> quick look ups.

> I never was able to learn via textbooks, at least for music theory, mostly I 
> think because I never made time to sit down on my own and learn through 
> reading, asking questions, research, all outside of the classroom, so these 
> notes mostly stem from the fundamentals and my attempts to find some
> sort of pattern that makes it stick in my brain.

> They also stem from just googling questions and following rabbit holes to see
> where they would lead, (e.g., comments, youtube masterclasses, reddit posts, etc.),
> and I will try to dig up and have links for where I found stuff, but again 
> most of this was handwritten so I didn't necessarily save links as I went, 
> will try my best though.


# Masterclass With Jean-Michel Pilc - New York Jazz Workshop part 2 
Pg: 1-5

## Preface: Large Scale Problem, Music Theory in Dark Ages
I remember Barry mentioned that we are in the dark ages for music theory,
at some point in my notes this will pop up again, this is from book 4 or 5.

I've been playing music for years and years and I've never been made aware of 
the following issues Jean speaks of. I always thought it was 'magic' when someone 
could whip something out in a synch, instead of being something learnable.

Im very grateful that I found this video during my first few days of returning
to theory, which is why its the first note ill be putting here, anyways,
back to the notes. You'll see what I mean, assuming you also haven't been made
aware of this.

## Intro
My first day of returning to music theory was actually just transcribing
some old piano sheet music I had onto manuscript paper and annotating the chords,
passing, tones, etc. So basically just an extension of what my university music
theory class was, and as such I quickly grew frustrated and had a panic attack,
(take a shot every time I use that word among these notes). 

I then began searching online for a good intro to re-begin my music theory 
structure, and somehow I ended up finding this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh5faWLCYsE&t=1171s 

The whole video is very interesting and he introduced the idea of internalizing
music, not from a spiritual perspective, but bringing up the problem that when
students play it may give the impression of an exercise being played vs
music, and music coming from the instrument and not their heads.

He gives a few analogies to explain this.

## Problem 1: Being Aware that it is a language
A short snippet before we get into the problems and which will make more sense 
after you have read the rest of the problems.

Jean brought up an email from his student saying 'So you said I have to listen
to Louis Armstrong Western Blues and learn it and transpose it. But Im confused
as to why I have to do this'.

Jean looked up at the class after saying that with a funny and bewildered look 
as if it were obvious. He said 'why do you have to listen do your parents 
growing up when you learn a language? Because that's the way you are going to 
learn it'. 

And said:
'people are not aware even aware for the most part that it is an language
and that oral tradition is going to be the way to learn music. It sounds absurd
but thats what Im saying. Buy many people have this thing that 'oh thats not how 
im going to learn, im going to by a real book, im going to learn theory, im going 
to learn F7 and all the modes and rhythmic modulations, why do I need to listen
to Louis Armstrong?'. So you see how they make that huge, to me fundamental mistake
is that they think you music is like how you learn how to make pasta like with 
recipes. So you always have to remember that music is really about aural tradition, 
about the sound, about what you hear, about what you receive, and how you can express 
it with a certain language. So listening to Louis Armstrong play Western Blues is 
really like listening to mum when you are two years old. Now of course you don't 
need to listen to mum when you are two years old but you do anyways.'

A woman in the audience responded by saying that she brought up some of the 
exercises from Jean's tape to her teacher, they sang and wrote things down and it
came out great.

Jean followed up by saying: 
'Yeah, I mean you don't even even need to write it down actually thats the 
thing. Do not write it down. Because if you write it down it becomes a visual 
thing already. Don't write it down, just leave the paper aside you know. I mean
can you believe that somebody like Erroll Garner the jazz pianist he couldn't write
music. I'm sure he did not want to actually. Because he knew if wrote it, it 
would be completely different'

And:
'Same with you don't need to know how to write to speak a language. Like again I 
go to the case with kids that you know that can speak before they can write. Don't 
write it down just sing it and play it, don't. You can even dispense of the paper.'

'You'll see its even more wonderful when you don't have the paper'

Theres more in the video if you are interested!

## Problem 2: Separating Internal Rhythm, Everyone is a Drummer
Jean starts by simply tapping his leg with his hand and asking what is he
doing? People funnily respond, 'tapping his leg', 'talking', etc. 

He response 'I am talking and tapping at the same time, so the person doing 
this (points to tapping) and the person doing this (points to mouth) are 
two separate people. 

He elaborates by explaining that the separation  is what allows him to do much 
more elaborate taps or improvise a rhythm of some kind while continuing to
have a conversation with the class or even counting in random speeds and times
(1,2,3. 6,7,8, 3,4,5). 

The first 'exercise' is having the class tap on their leg and at the same time
have a conversation with their neighbor, and sure enough no one was able to 
keep the tapping rhythm perfectly. 

This highlights the problem: conflict between different tasks.

Here, tapping and talking at the same time, causes the computer to crash, 
you brain. 

And even more so, if your rhythm goes wrong when you try to so something 
as simple and automatic as talk, imagine the difficulties that occur 
when you try to play music on your instrument which requires more 
brain power than having a conversation with your neighbor about what you ate
that morning. 

This is why the first issue that students have is lack of rhythm which leads 
to songs not grooving or falling in the pocket. This exercise is just a 
simple way of explaining why this issue happens. 

Simple daily exercises include just tapping while doing daily routines, 
reading the paper, talking to your partner, kids, and at first it will 
feel strange, but its not about performance, just about feeling comfortable 
with rhythm. And at some point you will feel the two things separate into 
two layers and internalization of the rhythm.

It may take days, weeks, months, depending on the person.

Another analogy is driving, if I'm driving and have a conversation, if 
the second I start the conversation my feet start jabbing and not working that 
immediately becomes a problem.

Eventually, the point of all of this is just to be able to sit at your 
instrument and play anything while having conversations.

And eventually, when you play it should be like driving. It should be in here 
(points to gut) instead of thinking. Because if I have to think about everything 
at the moment I play, then I can't really make music anymore. Then it 
becomes an intellectual thing and not the thing which is should be 
which is just music.

Now in a musical context, if I play two different rhythms on each of my hands 
it allows me oto play bass line on left and melody on right and more complex 
music.

In the terms of the person who keeps the rhythm, its my internal drummer,
my little friend that I follow. If the friend can play a simple high hat rhythm 
in time, ts t t ts t t, then im fine, but if the friend starts doing, ts tt t t ts,
because its bothered by whatever intellectual thing im playing, then 
we have a problem.

You have to have a good drummer inside of you in order to be a good musician. 
And the ability of the drummer determine the ability of the rhythmic skills 
of a musician.

It allows you to play whatever you want on top of that internal rhythm and allows 
you to know where you are in the music at all times, because if you don't know 
where you are, how can you expect the audience to follow you and know where you
are?

And this also opens the requirement to hear yourself while you are playing
instead of going eyes closed and saying oh this is the best while being
completely off rhythm.

## Problem 3: Fluency in Hearing Language: Melody in Different Keys Immediately
Jean continues by taking a simple melody in C major and has a student sing it 
back. He then switches keys, the student sings it back again, switches again
but the student is not able to do it immediately this time.

This highlights the first analogy: hearing language.

When you speak in a language, if you are fluent, you understand immediately 
the meaning behind the word or phrase. There is no thinking or translating
but the process is instant. The same for different ways to say 'hello' for 
example, (e.g., Hello, HELLO, hElLo, heLLO!)

Here the student, understands 'hello' when said in one way, but not in another 
way.

Jean brings it into the idea of improvising, so here the student, what they 
hear in their mind would not exactly be 'definitive', as they are lacking 
some level of fluency.

## Problem 4: Fluency in Speaking Language: Thinking of Melody, Playing Immediately
The second issue is suppose that you hear everything properly, such as being
able to do the first exercise of singing a phrase in different keys perfectly.

Some people can do that, but when they take their instruments, they cannot 
play it immediately, often with guitar players and sometimes piano players.

## Problem 5: Ill Compensation by Mechanics: Being Played By Your Instrument
Now, someone who has not been aware of the previous 2 issues may fix them
temporarily or long term by having very good mechanics, but this leads to
them being played by their instrument. So their musical brain is in their 
instrument, points at instrument, instead of here, points to head.

## Building Blocks: Start Over
Jean says that these are the main issues that they work on with their students
as its very 'illiterate and totally useless to talk about intervals and theory, 
and what should I play on such and such chord progression and how can I play 
7 step to heaven half a step above in 7/4 in rhythmic motivation, which are 
completely useless if I don't speak the language'.

'How can I write like Proust if I don't speak french'

## How Easy Is It To Learn
Someone asks the dumbest question I've heard, 'how easy is it to learn' 
like sure the first thing is how EASY is it, you lazy bum, instead of how
to learn it. Anyways, it just urked me lol.

## Back In My Day
Jean mentions how in his day, they had records, either with records or cassette,
and how he would hear a phrase, listen to it, and have to damage the record or
cassette by rewinding, by brbellbrlb, brelblerbl (sound of a cassette tape 
rewinding).

Now we have youtube which is free, and you can even slow down the audio without
changing the pitch "for gods sake". So its so much easier.

## Youtube: Listen and Listen
He says go listen to good musicians, not Coltrane, Chris Pauler, Keith Garret,
but go listen to louis armstrong.

Hw: Listen to Western Blues
1. Listen to the first head he plays 
2. Learn it, sing it until you know it by memory
3. Then try to sing it in another key
4. Then try to play it on your instrument

This is what Jean works on with his instruments, different phrases,
different keys.

Sometimes just the first bar or few notes. If you can transpose 
the first two notes then thats much better than not being able to hear it
at all.

There is so much material on youtube you can use for that. You can use
Lester Young, you can use the great singers Billie Holiday, Ella, Fitzgerald.

Once you can use that pretty easily then maybe its time to switch to 
bebop. One thing at a time, it takes time.

## Frustrations
This process is different from student to student, because nobody hears 
the same, and nobody has the same problems, and everybody has different 
weak points.

Some people hear perfectly, but don't hear the bass. Here you 
sing base lines, transcribe basslines, Paul Chambers, Jimmie Benton, 
again going back to the roots.

And then trying to understand the bassline works, play it on the instrument,
transpose it, hear it, sing it, and see if you can hear the melody 
at the same time.

## Building Stereo + Building the Bookshelf
Hearing the bass and melody is building the stereo in a students mind. Can
I hear the bass and can I hear the melody. For us, if we have a book on a 
shelf, the bass is the left book end and the melody is the right book end. If 
you don't hear the bass, sprtb, the books fall. If you don't hear the melody,
sprtb, the books fall. If you remove the rhythm which is the shelf itself,
everything already falls. 
 
So before we talk about chords which everyone is obsessed about, build 
your shelf, bookend.

Ray Charles: "I just play the melody, it just happens to be in the lower 
register"

You have the bass and melody, and everything else is just filling. So before 
you get to the filling you have to make sure you make sure the essential
pieces are there, the left and right bookend and the shelf.

## Good Painters Draw
Jean makes another analogy that you cannot be a good painter without knowing 
how to draw. You can make a fortune, anybody can make a fortune nowadays.
But to be a good painter.

But to him, a good painter is somebody who starts by drawing. Picasso drew 
all the time. Painting for him was this big thing, but he drew all the time,
and he never made a painting without drawing first what he had in mind. So 
drawing here is the bass and bookshelf.

get the 6th diminished scale

# Practice: Chord Identification
Pg 20-32

Retrospective:
I was writing out chords by brute force memorizing the notes, instead
of having the scale by memory and building the chord manually. In other
words: 

Bad: 
D, whats the major? ... think think, too long.

Instead:
D, whats the major? Well the triad is DFA, and I know D has F# and C#,
so the major is DF#A.
Its quicker to separate the triad, from the scale modification.

# Chromatic Scale
Pg 35

Going Up:
do, di, re, ri, mi, fa, fi, sol, si, la, li, ti, do

Going Down:
do, ti, te, la, le, sol, se, fa, mi, me, re, ra, do

# Transcribing: Red Garland Almost like Being In Love 
Pg 36-39

Retrospective:
Waste of time, we are BANNING paper, as all the changes and chords
don't matter at all. The solfege and how it sounds are what matter
and paper is just a crutch.

# Chromatic Scale: Diminished Scales Below/Above/On the 2nd
Pg 40

Given the chromatic scale, find a shortcut to get the 3 diminished
scales for a key.

do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do

1. di, mi, sol, li -> te, so, mi, ra

2. ri, fi, la, do -> do, la, se, me

3. re, fa, si, ti -> ti, le, fa, re

Retrospective:
A few weeks later we made a quicker method using numbers

1. 1/2, 3, 5, 6/7
2. 2/3, 4/5, 6, 1
3. 2, 4, 5/6, 7

Which can we read 2 ways, going towards or away from notes. Lets
see if you can see the pattern I mean:

1. 6+, 1+, 3, 5 || 3, 5, 7-, 2-
2. 2+, 4+, 6, 1 || 6, 1, 3-, 4-
3. 5+, 7, 2, 4  || 7, 2, 4, 6-

Retrospective: 
This connects to Barry's way of saying the 3 diminished scales are
below, above, and on the second

1. 6+, 1+, 3, 5 || 3, 5, 7-, 2-  == below the second
2. 2+, 4+, 6, 1 || 6, 1, 3-, 4-  == above the second
3. 5+, 7, 2, 4  || 7, 2, 4, 6-   == on the second


# Barry Harris: Diminished Scales Below/Above/On the 2nd
Pg 41

Going up and down a scale while switching between major and the
3 diminished scales

Below the 2nd
1. do, re, mi, fa -> sol, la, ti, la -> sol, fa, mi, re
2. di, mi, sol, li
3. te, sol, mi, ra

Above the 2nd
4. do, re, mi, fa -> sol, la, ti, la -> sol, fa
5. se, me, do, la
6. la, do, ri, fi

On the 2nd
7. do, re, mi, fa -> sol, la, ti, la

Retrospective:
On the right track, we made the connection a few months later: 

We have 7 main keys we want to memorize, and from there we can
quickly derive the other keys using these 7 main keys.

Ex: C#
Lets say we know C by heart, how do we get to C#? Just sharp
everything in C major.

C -> C#
D -> D# 
E -> E#
F -> F#
G -> G#
A -> A#
B -> B#
 
Ex: E
Lets say we know Eb by heart, how do we get to #? Just sharp
everything in Eb major.

Eb -> E
F  -> F#
G  -> G#
Ab -> A
Bb -> B
C  -> C#
D  -> D#

p.s. there is one more trick that helps me remember, but I wouldn't
write all my discoveries here would I? ;) 
Ask me if you're interested!

Retrospective:
Good intro to intervals, but waste of time. The quicker way to 
determine intervals is to have a major scale memorized. So you can just
go from:

Ex: C Major 
C -> G: Perfect 5th
C -> B: Major 7th
etc.
