## Two Pointer Intro:

Getting aquanted and learning how two simple pointers can can 'point' to the solution

### What are Two Pointers 
First lets understand what two pointers are 



## 125. Valid Palindrome

### Intro
> A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters 
> and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. 
> Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.
> Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

|  Input                             | Output  |  
| ---------------------------------- | ------- | 
| "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"   | true    | 
| "race a car"                       | false   |
| " "                                | true    |

### Constraints
s consists only of printable ASCII characters.

### Abstraction 
Not much abstraction is needed but rather steps

First we need to convert the string s into lowercase.
Then we need to remove non-alphanumeric characters, isalnum() comes handy 
Then simple traverse or reverse the string to compare

### Solution 1: Two Pointers L + R
```python
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        
        # simultanious assignment
        l, r = 0, len(s) - 1

        while l < r:
            
            # moving pointer until it hits an alphaNum
            while l < r and not self.alphaNum(s[l]):
                l += 1
            while r > l and not self.alphaNum(s[r]):
                r -= 1

            # check the current alphaNum for match 
            if s[l].lower() != s[r].lower():
                return False

            # move the points to next step
            l, r = l + 1, r - 1

        return True
    
    # simple way for alphaNum check
    def alphaNum(self, c):
        return (ord('A') <= ord(c) <= ord('Z') or 
                ord('a') <= ord(c) <= ord('z') or 
                ord('0') <= ord(c) <= ord('9'))
```

Here we simply follow the steps we mentioned above. 

Use pointers l and r, skip over all non-alphaNum chars, 
then check if the pointers match, and continue until the pointer hit eachother

### Solution 2: Reverse String
```python 
def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
    ans = ""
    for c in s.lower():
        if c.isalnum():
            ans += c
    return ans == ans[::-1]
        
``` 
For this problem, its actually quicker to use the library functions as the alphaNum function from 
solution 1 is incredibly slow

We simply loop over the string after calling lowercase, then add only the alphaNumeric characters 
to the string that reverse and check over.
