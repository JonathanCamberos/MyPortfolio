## Intro

Trees are hierachical data structures representing relationships
between entities, often in a parent-child format.
Trees are a special type of graph, characters by:

1. Nodes: The entities (ex: values, objects)

2. Edges: The connections between the entities. A tree with n nodes has n - 1 edges.

3. Root: The top-most node, with no parent

4. Leaves: Nodes with no children 

5. Height: The number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf

6. Depth: The number of edges from the root to a specific node

7. Cycles: Trees do not contain cycles

8. Paths: Trees have exactly one path between any two nodes

Tree:
```
      1
     / \
    2   3
       / \
      4   5
```

Parent Array:
```
Index (Node):   1   2   3   4   5
Parent:        N/A  1   1   3   3
```
