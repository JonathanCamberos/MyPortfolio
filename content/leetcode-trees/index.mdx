## Intro

Trees are hierachical data structures representing relationships
between entities, often in a parent-child format.
Trees are a special type of graph, characters by:

1. Nodes: The entities (ex: values, objects)

2. Edges: The connections between the entities. A tree with n nodes has n - 1 edges.

3. Root: The top-most node, with no parent

4. Leaves: Nodes with no children 

5. Height: The number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf

6. Depth: The number of edges from the root to a specific node

7. Cycles: Trees do not contain cycles

8. Paths: Trees have exactly one path between any two nodes

Tree:
```
      1
     / \
    2   3
       / \
      4   5
```

Parent Array:
```
Index (Node):   1   2   3   4   5
Parent:        N/A  1   1   3   3
```

### Tree Application: MinHeap

Use a MinHeap, a type of binary tree, to maintain the smallest or
highest-priority elements efficiently. 

Ex: Find the Top K Frequent Elements in a List
```python
    def topKFrequent(nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        from collections import defaultdict
        import heapq

        # Step 1: Frequency count for each unique integer
        count = defaultdict(int)  # O(m) space complexity for m unique integers
        for num in nums:  # O(n) time complexity to iterate over n integers
            count[num] += 1

        # Step 2: Use a MinHeap to track the k most frequent elements
        minHeap = []  # O(k) space complexity for k elements
        for num, freq in count.items():  # O(m) time complexity for m unique integers
            heapq.heappush(minHeap, (freq, num))  # O(log k) for each insertion
            if len(minHeap) > k:  # Ensure heap size remains k
                heapq.heappop(minHeap)  # O(log k) for each removal

        # Step 3: Extract the elements from the heap
        return [num for freq, num in minHeap]  # O(k) time complexity to extract results

    # Example:
    # Input: nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3], k = 2
    # Output: [1, 2]
```
