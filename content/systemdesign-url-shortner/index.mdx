# 1. Design Bit.ly

Topics: Scaling Reads

Bit.ly is a URL shortening service that converts long URLs into shorter, 
manageable links. It also provides analytics for the shortened URLs.

# Functional Requirements ::2::

> Features needed to satisfy the needs of the user.

## In Scope

1. Users should be able to submit a long URL and receive a shortened URL.

- Optionally, users should be able to specify a custom alias.

- Optionally, users should be able to specify an expiration date.

2. Users should be able to access the original URL by using the shortened URL.

## Out of Scope

1. User authentication and account management

2. Analytics on link clicks (e.g., click counts, geographic data).


# Non Functional Requirements ::4::

> Specifications about how a system operates, rather than what tasks it performs.
> Defines system attributes like scalability, latency, security, availability,
> and are often framed as specific benchmarks.
> (e.g., system's ability to handle 100 million daily active users,
> response to queries within 200 milliseconds)

## Benchmarks

1. System should ensure uniqueness for short codes (no two long URLs should
map to the same short URL)

2. Redirection should occur with minimal delay (< 100 ms)

3. System should be reliable and available 99.99% of the time
(availability > consistency)

4. System should scale to support 1B shortened URLs and 100M DAU

## Out of Scope

1. Data consistency in real time analytics

2. Advanced security features like spam detection and malicious URL filtering.

Note: 
The important consideration in this system is the imbalance 
between reads and writes.
The ratio is skewed towards reads, 
since users will more frequently access shortened URLs vs create new ones.
(e.g., average pf 1000 reads to 1 create).
Our caching strategies, database choices, and architecture
will revolve around this.

# Set Up

## Entities

> The core objects or concepts within a system which define its 
> functionality and data.

In our case simple, but still good to list out.
The core entities are the long URL, short URL, and user.

# API: the delivery framework ::2::

> The contract between the client and the server
> and first point of reference in high level design.
> Usually map 1:1 with functional requirements.

1. POST: Generate a new short URL

A POST endpoint to intake the long URL, 
optional alias, optional expiration date, and return the short URL.

```json
// Generate short URL from long URL
Request: POST/{long_url}
Body:
    {
        "long_url": "https://www.example.com/some/very/long/url",
        "custom_alias": "optional_custom_alias",
        "expiration_date": "optional_expiration_date"
    }
    
Response: HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Body:
    {
        "short_url": "http://short.ly/abc123"
    }
```

2. GET: Retrieve an existing long URL

A GET endpoint that intakes the short url,
and redirects the user to the original long URL.

```json
// Using short URL, redirect to original long URL
Request: GET/{short_url}

Response: HTTP 302 Redirect to the original long URL
```


# High Level Design Functional Requirement 1: User submits a long URL and receives a short URL

## Core components

Core components high level:
1. Client: Users interact with system through web or mobile app
2. Primary Server: Receives requests from client and handles logic
3. Database: Stores mapping of short URLs to long URLs, user generated aliases, and expiration dates

## POST Diagram
```python
User submits a long URL and receives a short URL():

                            +--------+
Request:                    | Client |          Response:

    "custom_alias": ...         |               }
    "expiration_date": ...      |                or 
}                               |               HTTP 400/409/500 (failure)
                                |               {
                                |                   "error": "..."
                                |               }
                                v                   
                        +------------------+
Write():                | Primary Server   |    On Success: 
1) generate short URL   +------------------+        Return short URL
2) SQL Query (INSERT)           ^               On Failure:
                                |                   Return error msg
                                |
                                |
                                v
                            +-----------+
Urls Table                  | Database  |    SQL Insert: 
{                           +-----------+    INSERT INTO Urls (...)     
    string short_url

    created_by                                      
}
```

## POST Processing Steps

1. Client Request()

Client sends a POST request to */urls*:
Sends long URL, custom alias, expiration dates.

2. Primary Server processes Request() 

Validates that is a real URL (to avoid unnecessary shortening),
via open-source library like is-url or our own validation

Validates that it does not already exist in our system (to avoid collisions),
via querying our database to check if long URL is already present

3. Primary Server Validation()

If URL is valid and does not already exist, we can generate a short URL
Abstract this to magic function for now

If user specified alias, we can use that as short code

4. Primary Server Insert Database()

Once short URL is generated, we insert it into our database
Store short URL, long URL, and expiration date

5. Primary Server Response()

Return short URL to client.
Send back response to client with short URL.


# High Level Design Functional Requirement 2: User can access original long URL by using short URL

## Core components

Core components high level:
1. Client: Users interact with system through web or mobile app
2. Primary Server: Receives requests from client and handles logic
3. Database: Stores mapping of short URLs to long URLs, user generated aliases, and expiration dates

## GET Processing Steps

1. User Request()

User browser sends a GET request to serve with short URL *GET /abc123*

2. Primary Server Processes Request()

Primary server receives this request and looks up the short code in database

3. Primary Server Lookup and Validation()

If short code is found and not expired, server retrieves corresponding long URL.


4. Primary Server Response()

Server sends HTTP redirect response to user's browser, sending it to long URL.
There are two main HTTP redirects we could use for this purpose:

- HTTP/1.1 301 (Permanent Redirect):
Indicate resource has permanently moved to target URL, which will typically
cause browsers to cache this responses, leading to future requests for
the short URL to go directly to the long URL, bypassing the server.

- HTTP/1.1 302 (Temporary Redirect):
Indicate resource has temporary moved to target URL, which browsers
do not cache this response, leading to future requests for the short URL 
to go through our primary server first.

We will use 302 redirect because:

- Prevents browser caching and gives us direct control over redirection 
process, in case we need to update or expire links as needed

- Allows us to track click statistics for each short URL, since it is
forced to go through our primary server

User requests a short URL and is redirected to the original URL:

    created_by                                      
}
```


# Deep Dive 1: Short and Unique Urls

## Constraints

We need to ensure:

1. Each short URLs should be unique
2. Keep short URLs as short as possible
3. Efficiently generate short URLs

## Bad Solution: Long URL Prefix

Approach:

The simplest thing we could do is take a prefix of the input as the short code.

```h
www.linkedin.com/ -> www.short.ly/www.link
```

Challenges: 

This would break constraint 1. as different URLs could have the same short URL.


## Good Solution: Random Number Generator or Hash Function

Approach:

To add entropy (randomness) to ensure our codes our unique, we could
try a random number generator or hash function.

Challenges:

Even with entropy, there is a non negligible changes of generating duplicate
short codes, due to our constraint 2 of short codes.
Tis leads to a necessity of either generating longer short codes (breaking 
constraint 2) or adding a check for already existing code which becomes a 
bottleneck as the system scales (breaking constraint 3)

## Great Solution: Unique Counter with Base62 Encoding

Approach:

One solution to guaranteeing no collisions is to increment a counter for each 
new url. We would then take the output and encode it using base62 encoding
to ensure short representation.

Each counter value would be unique which then eliminates the risk of collisions.

Challenges: 

In a distributed environment, maintaining a single global counter can be 
challenging due to synchronization issues. 
All instances of our primary server would need to agree on the counter value.

Challenges:

With length, if we have 1B urls, when base62 encoded will lead to 6 character
strings. 

So we would need to move to 7 character codes once we hit the trillions.


# Deep Dive 2: Fast Redirection to Original URL

## Constraints

Within context of a large database of shortened URLs
we need to ensure:

1. Find correct long URL quickly for smooth user experience
2. Optimizations to avoid 'full table scans' on short URL keys

## Good Solution: Add an Index

Approach:

To avoid full table scans, we can use indexing.
An index will create a separate, sorted list of short URLs,
each with a pointer to the full information in the database table.
This allows us to use efficient search methods reducing lookup time.

1. B-Tree Indexing
A B-Tree is a specialize m-way tree designed to optimize data access,
especially on disk-based storage systems.

```python
                 +--------+
                 | 30     |
                 +--------+
                /          \
       +--------+--------+   +--------+--------+
       | 10     | 20     |   | 40     | 50     |
       +--------+--------+   +--------+--------+
      /    |        |       /    |        |    
    ...   ...      ...    ...   ...      ...   
```

B-Trees allow for fast data retrieval and updates by maintaining a 
balanced tree.

In our case, we would create a B-Tree index on the short code column 
providing O(log n) lookup.

2. Primary Key

For out database, we designate the short URL as the primary key of
our table.
This gives the benefits of indexing and uniqueness of short URLs.

3. Hash Indexing

For databases that support it (e.g., PostgreSQL), we can use 
hash indexing on the short URL column.
This provides O(1) average lookup time.

Challenges:

Relying solely on a disk-based database for redirects will present 
some challenges.

A typical SSD can handle ~100,000 Input/Output Operations Per Second.

The issue is the volume of read operations for our application.
With 100M DAU, averaging each user does 5 reads() per day:

```python
100,000,000 users * 5 redirects = 500,000,000 redirects per day

86,400 seconds per day

500,000,000 / 86,400 seconds ~= 5,787 redirects per second
```

And this is assuming evenly distributed reads() throughout the day
which is unrealistic. Most reads() will occur during peak hours,
meaning we need to design for high traffic spikes.

```python
spikes 100x more traffic

(500,000,000 * 100) / 86,400 seconds ~= 578,700 redirects per second
```

A single database will struggle to keep up with the volume of traffic.
A high read load would then lead to increased response times,
potential timeouts, and could slowdown other database operations like write().



## Great Solution: Implementing an In Memory Cache (e.g, Redis)

Approach:

To improve redirect speed, we can add an in-memory cache like 
Redis or Memcached which will sit in between the primary server
and database. 

The cache will store frequently accessed mappings of short codes 
to long URLs. When a redirect request comes in, the server will 
first check the cache. 

If short code is found (cache hit) it will grab the long URL from 
cache. This will significantly reduce latency from reads().

If short code is not found (cache miss) it will query the database,
retrieve the long URL, and store it in the cache for future requests.

Note: we are mapping directly from memory instead of disk
```python
    Memory access time: ~100 nanoseconds (0.0001 ms)

    SSD access time: ~0.1 milliseconds

    HDD access time: ~10 milliseconds
```

Which means memory access is about 1,000 times faster, which
increases our reads() even more:

```python
    Memory: 1,000,000 IOPS 

    SSD: ~100,000 IOPS

    HDD: ~100-200 IOPS
```

```python
User requests a short URL and is redirected to the original URL:

                                +--------+
Request:                        | Client |          Response:
GET/{short_url}                 +--------+          HTTP 302: Found
                                    ^               {
                                    |                   "Location": "https://www.example.com/"
                                    |               }
                                    |               or
                                    |               HTTP 404/410/500 (failure)
                                    |               {
                                    |                   "error": "..."
                                    |               }
                                    v
                            +------------------+                        +-------------+

                                    v
                                +-----------+

    string short_url                                
    string original_url

    created_by                                      
}
```

Challenges:

Implementing in-memory cache offers performance improvements.

It also adds the need to complex cases, such as cache invalidation
for updates or deletions (which for us can more or less be ignored
since URLs are read heavy).

The cache would also need to 'warm-up' before the performance benefits
kick in, leading to initial requests still hitting the database
until cache is populated.

Memory limits would also require decision s about cache size,
eviction policies (e.g., LRU).

Overall, it does offer performance benefits, but also adds
tradeoffs and invalidation strategies that need to be worked out

## Great Solution: Leveraging Content Deliver Networks (CDNs) and Edge Computing

# Deep Dive 3: Scaling to 1B shortened URLs and 100M DAU

## Constraints

Lets start with the size of the database.

```python
Long URL Table:             
                 | ------------------------- |
Indexing -->     | Short URL (~8 bytes)      |
                 | Long URL (~100 bytes)     |
                 | creation Time (~8 bytes)  |
                 | custom alias (~100 bytes) |
                 | expiration date (~8 bytes)|
                 | ------------------------- |

Leading to ~200 bytes per row
Rounding up to ~500 bytes to account for additional metadata
such as creator id, analytics id, etc.
```

If we store 1B shortened URLS we are looking at around:

```python
~500 bytes * 1B rows = 500 GB of data
```

500 GB is within the capabilities of SSDs.
And given that the number of urls is limited by the number of urls 
on the internet, we can expect it to grow but only modestly.

If we were to hit the hardware limit, we could shard our data across 
multiple servers, but for now a single Postgres instance as mentioned
previously should be ok.

To estimate, we could say 100k new urls are created per day.

```python
100k urls per day 

86,400 seconds in day

100k / 86,400 ~= Insert 1 row per second
```

Most database technology should can handle this as we already fixed the 
heavy read throughput via cache and have bounded our write throughput 
as low.

Challenges:

What if the DB goes down?

1. Database Replication

By using a database like Postgres that supports replication, we can 
create multiple identical copies of our database on different servers.
If one goes down we can redirect to another.

This adds complexity to our system as we need to ensure our 
Primary Server can interact with any replica without issues,
adding operational overhead.

2. Database Backup 

We could implement a backup system that periodically takes snapshot of 
our database and stores it in a separate location.

This adds complexity to our system as we need to ensure our 
Primary Server can interact with the backup without any issues,
adding operational overhead.


Approach:

What about our Primary Server?

We can split our Primary Server by separating read() and write() operations.
A microservice architecture where Read() Services handle redirects while
Write() Services handle the creation of new short URLS.
It allows use to scale each service independently based on specific demand.

We can add multiple instances of the Read() and Write() services to horizontally
scale and distribute our load across multiple servers.

This can allow us to handle a large number of requests per second 
without increasing the load on a single server, and thus when a new request
comes in, it is randomly routed to one of the instances of the server.


Approach:

What about our counter?

Horizontally scaling our write services means that we need a single source
of truth for the counter as it needs to be accessible to all instances
of the Write Service so they can agree on the next value.

We could solve this with a centralized Redis instance to store the counter
and other metadata that needs to be shared across all instances of the 
Write Service.
And since Redis is single-threaded, very fast for this use case, and 
allows for atomic increment operations: 'all or nothing' units of work that
atomically add value to a memory location, in our case creating a short URL,
we can increment the global counter without any issues.

```python

Challenge:

Should we be concerned about network overhead?
Not really, network request is negligible compared to other operations in
the system. However, we could also do 'counter batching' to reduce network requests.

The Redis Global Counter, instead of incrementing per operation, will 
instead issue batch groups of 1000 to each instance of the Write() service.
So a Write service cna use 1000 values locally without needing to contact
Redis for a new URL.

Now with the batch counters, if a write service goes down before using the
1000 values locally, the global counter in Redis has already been incremented
so these local values will never be used.

This is not an issue however, because we will need up to a trillion short URLs
before we need a 7 character short codes (refer to short code section), so
we can tolerate a fair amount of loss for batch counters.
