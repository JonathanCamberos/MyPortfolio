## Sliding Intro:

Leetcode problems with elegant solutions using the sliding window technique. 

### What is Sliding Window
Sliding Window is a technique used for iterating over a subset of data
within a larger structure (like arrays or strings) by maintaining 
a moving window that can expand, contract, or shift across the input.

There are two main types of sliding windows:
1. Fixed size (constant length) window
2. Variable size (dynamic length) window

Sliding window often replaces nested loops by reusing computation 
from the previous window to achieve better efficiency.

### Why Use Sliding Window
Sliding Window is ideal for problems that involve:
- Finding optimal subarray/substring
- Summation or counting within a range
- Tracking a condition inside a window

It typically reduces time complexity from O(n<sup>2</sup>) (naive nested loops) 
to O(n) since each element is processed at most twice (entering/exiting the window).

### Binary Search Application: Fixed Size Window
Fixed size windows help maintain a constant window of k elements 
while scanning through a sequence.

Ex: Maximum sum of any subarray of size k
```python
    def maxSumSubarray(nums, k):
        window_sum = sum(nums[:k])
        max_sum = window_sum
        
        for i in range(k, len(nums)):
            window_sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k]
            max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
        
        return max_sum

    # maxSumSubarray([1, 4, 2, 10, 2, 3, 1, 0, 20], 4) = 24
```

### Sliding Window Application: Variable Size Window
Variable size windows expand and shrink dynamically depending on 
whether some condition or constraint is met (e.g., substring uniqueness, 
sum ≤ target).

Ex: Longest substring without repeating characters
```python
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:
        char_index = {}
        left = max_len = 0
        
        for right in range(len(s)):
            if s[right] in char_index and char_index[s[right]] >= left:
                left = char_index[s[right]] + 1
            
            char_index[s[right]] = right
            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
        
        return max_len

    # "abcabcbb" → lengthOfLongestSubstring = 3
```

        # If  prices[left] < prices[right], calculate profit and update max
        # Else prices[left] > prices[right], move left to right as lower buy price found
        # Tracks low buy and max profit in a single pass

        # Low Buy Day, Right Sell Day
        left, right = 0, 1

        # profit
        max_profit = 0

        # while sell days available and not out of potential lower buy days

            # if possible profit
            if prices[left] < prices[right]:
                # compare profit with max
                profit = prices[right] - prices[left]
                max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)

            # lower buy day found, update buy day
            else:
                left = right

            # traverse sell days

## 239. Sliding Window Maximum ::1:: - Hard

Topics:  Array, Queue, Sliding Window, Heap (Priority Queue), Monotonic Queue

### Intro
> You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window 
> of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very
> right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time 
> the sliding window moves right by one position.
> Return the max sliding window.

|  Example Input           | Output |  
| ---------------- | ------ | 
| nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3 | Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7] |
| nums = [1], k = 1 | [1] |  
 
Constraints:

1 &leq; nums.length &leq; 10<sup>5</sup>

-10<sup>4</sup> &leq; nums[i] &leq; 10<sup>4</sup>

1 &leq; k &leq; nums.length

### Abstraction
Given list of nums and sliding window size k, return array of 
largest sum for every window within the list.

### Solution 1: Heap (Priority Queue) Approach - Sliding Window/Variable Size Window
```python
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        if not nums or k == 0:
            return []

        result = []
        heap = []  # Max-heap implemented as min-heap with negative values

        # Initialize the first window
        for i in range(k):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-nums[i], i))

        result.append(-heap[0][0])

        for i in range(k, len(nums)):
            # Push new element
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-nums[i], i))

            # Pop elements out of the current window range
            while heap[0][1] <= i - k:
                heapq.heappop(heap)

            # The current max is at the heap top
            result.append(-heap[0][0])

        return result
```

### Solution 2: Sliding Window + Monotonic Queue - Sliding Window/Variable Size Window
```python
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        if not nums or k == 0:
            return []

        result = []
        dq = deque()  # Stores indices of elements, maintaining decreasing order of values

        for i in range(n):
            # Remove indices of elements smaller than current from the back
            while dq and nums[i] >= nums[dq[-1]]:
                dq.pop()

            # Add current element index
            dq.append(i)

            # Remove front if it's out of current window
            if dq[0] <= i - k:
                dq.popleft()

            # Once first window is processed, append max (front of deque)
            if i >= k - 1:
                result.append(nums[dq[0]])

        return result
```

        q = deque()
        it = iter(nums)
        for v in islice(it, k):
            while q and q[-1] < v: q.pop()
            q.append(v)
        ans = [q[0]]
        for i, v in enumerate(it):
            if q[0] == nums[i]: q.popleft()
            while q and q[-1] < v: q.pop()
            q.append(v)
