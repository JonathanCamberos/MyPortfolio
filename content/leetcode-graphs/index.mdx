## Intro

Graphs are data structures representing relationships
between entities. Graphs contain:

Vertices (n): The entities (ex: nodes)

Edges (m): The connections between entities


### Graph Representations: Adjacency Matrix

Graph:
```
    1---2
     \ /
      3
```

Adjacency Matrix Representation (n = 3):
```
        1  2  3
    1  [0, 1, 1]
    2  [1, 0, 1]
    3  [1, 1, 0]
```

The rows and columns represent vertices.

A[i][j] = 1 indicates an edge between vertex i and vertex j.

A[i][j] = 0 indicates no edge

### Graph Representations: Adjacency List

Graph:
```
    1---2
     \ /
      3
```

Adjacency List Representation (n = 3, m = 3):
```
    1: [2, 3]
    2: [1, 3]
    3: [1, 2]
```

Each vertex points to a list of its neighbors

Space-efficient for sparse graphs

### Graph Representations: Edge List

Graph:
```
    1---2
     \ /
      3
```

Edge List Representation (m = 3):
```
    Edges:
    (1, 2)
    (1, 3)
    (2, 3)
```

Each edge is explicitly listed as a pair of vertices (u,v)

Simplest representation for algorithms that only care about edges.
