# Graphs Intro

LeetCode problems with graph based solutions.

## What is a Graph?

A graph is a data structure used to represent relationships between entities.

## Graph Characteristics

1. Vertices (n): entities (e.g. nodes)
2. Edges (m): connections between entities
3. Direction: Edges can be directed (nodes pointing to nodes), or undirected (no one pointing)
4. Weight: Edges can have weight (e.g. cost, time) or unweighted
5. Unordered: unlike tree, heaps, etc, graphs allow cycles, multiple paths, and varying connectivity
6. Representation: Graphs are stored as adjacency matrix, adjacency list, or edge lists depending on the use case

## Graph Representations: Adjacency Matrix

Graph and Matrix:
```
        1---2
         \ /
          3


        1  2  3
    1  [0, 1, 1]
    2  [1, 0, 1]
    3  [1, 1, 0]
```

A[i][j] = 1 -> edge exists between i and j

A[i][j] = 0 -> no edge between i and j

Space complexity O(n<sup>2</sup>) -> better for dense graphs

## Graph Representations: Adjacency List

Graph and List
```
        1---2
         \ /
          3

    1: [2, 3]
    2: [1, 3]
    3: [1, 2]
```

Each vertex points to its neighbors

Space complexity: O(n + m) -> efficient for sparse graphs

## Graph Representations: Edge List

Graph and Edge List
```
        1---2
         \ /
          3

    Edges:
    (1, 2)
    (1, 3)
    (2, 3)
```

Stores all edges explicitly as (u, v) pairs

Space complexity O(m) -> useful for algorithms that only need edges

Simplest representation for algorithms that only care about edges.

## Graph Application: DFS Pre Order
Use pre order DFS when you need to process a node immediately before
exploring its neighbors

Ex: Sink islands or mark visited immediately in a grid
```python
def dfs_pre(r, c, grid):
    if not (0 <= r < len(grid) and 0 <= c < len(grid[0])) or grid[r][c] == '0':
        return

    grid[r][c] = '0'  # mark visited (pre-order processing)

    for dr, dc in [(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)]:
        dfs_pre(r + dr, c + dc, grid)

# Example: numIslands uses pre-order DFS to flood fill
```

## Graph Application: DFS In Order (Binary Tree Only)
Use in order DFS mainly for binary trees where left -> right order matters

Ex: Extract sorted values from a BST
```python
def inorder(node, res):
    if not node:
        return
    inorder(node.left, res)
    res.append(node.val)  # process node in between left/right
    inorder(node.right, res)

# Example: LeetCode 98, Validate BST or BST inorder traversal
```


## Graph Application: DFS Post Order
Use post order DFS when you want to process a node after exploring
all its neighbors.


Ex: Calculate size of connected components or backtracking cleanup
```python
def dfs_post(r, c, grid):
    if not (0 <= r < len(grid) and 0 <= c < len(grid[0])) or grid[r][c] == '0':
        return 0

    grid[r][c] = '0'  # mark visited
    size = 1  # count current cell

    for dr, dc in [(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)]:
        size += dfs_post(r + dr, c + dc, grid)

    return size  # post-order: aggregate after children

# Example: maxAreaOfIsland uses post-order DFS to sum area
```

## Graph Application: BFS Level Order / Flood Fill
Use BFS when you need shortest path in unweighted graphs, or to
expand layers level by level.

Ex: Shortest path in 2D grid:
```python
def bfs_shortest(grid, start):
    queue = deque([(*start, 0)])  # (r, c, distance)
    visited = set([start])

    while queue:
        r, c, dist = queue.popleft()
        if grid[r][c] == 'target':
            return dist

        for dr, dc in [(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)]:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < len(grid) and 0 <= nc < len(grid[0]) and (nr,nc) not in visited:
                visited.add((nr,nc))
                queue.append((nr,nc, dist + 1))
```

## Graph Application: Union Find Disjoint Set
Use Union Find to efficiently track connected components in dynamic graphs.

Ex: Count islands or merge friend groups
```python
    def numIslandsUnion(grid):
        parent = {}
        
        def find(x):
            if parent[x] != x:
                parent[x] = find(parent[x])
            return parent[x]
        
        def union(x, y):
            parent[find(x)] = find(y)
        
        for r in range(len(grid)):
            for c in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[r][c] == '1':
                    parent[(r,c)] = (r,c)
        
        for r in range(len(grid)):
            for c in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[r][c] == '1':
                    for dr, dc in [(1,0),(0,1)]:
                        nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
                        if (nr,nc) in parent:
                            union((r,c),(nr,nc))
        
        roots = {find(x) for x in parent}
        return len(roots)
```

## Solution 1: Recursive DFS Late Pruning With Tracking Visited Set - Graph/something
```python
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:

        # Connected Components In A Graph:
        # This problem is equivalent to finding out the number of connected components in a graph
        # Each land cell ('1') is a node, and edges exist between two nodes if they
        # are adjacent vertically or horizontally

        # Backtracking vs Recursive Graph Traversal:
        # Recursion is a concept, backtracking is a technique using it.
        # Recursion doesn't imply you are backtracking.
        # Backtracking is the concept of returning 'state' back to what it was at the parent call. 
        # 'State' is data, it can be a collection (array,map,etc). State can also be a primitive var. 
        # This problem uses recursion but is not backtracking since we are not tracking nor reverting state.

        # Recursive Graph Traversal:
        # Although recursion returns to previous cells to explore other neighbors,
        # this is not backtracking in the algorithmic sense.
        # Backtracking requires undoing choices (e.g., path.pop()) to explore
        # alternative solution paths from the same state.
        # In this graph traversal, once a cell is marked visited, it is never unmarked,
        # and we simply recurse.
        # Therefore, this is DFS for connected components, not backtracking.

## Solution 4: Union Find Early Pruning - Graph/something
```python 
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:

        # Connected Components In A Graph:
        # This problem is equivalent to finding out the number of connected components in a graph
        # Each land cell ('1') is a node, and edges exist between two nodes if they
        # are adjacent vertically or horizontally

        # Union-Find vs BFS/DFS:

        # DFS/BFS are traversal algorithms. When you start from one land cell, you must walk the entire island.
        # If you skip even one direction, you may fail to reach part of the island.
        
        # Union-Find is not traversing the island — it is connecting components while scanning the grid.

        # In other words, DFS/BFS must finish when its starts. 
        # Union-Find on the other hand connects components as it goes, so it does not have to completely finish

        # That distinction is one of the key reasons Union-Find can safely use only right/down 
        # while DFS/BFS must explore all 4 directions as DFS must explore all its options, 
        # but Union Find will eventually finish as we iterate so we only need down right.
        
        # Island To Water Mimicking Via Union(x, y) Same Root Ignoring:
        # In Union-Find, we can think of each connected land cell as a node in a tree.
        # When we union two adjacent land cells, they share the same root, meaning they belong
        # to the same island (connected component). By checking 'if rootX == rootY: return',
        # we effectively ignore pairs that are already connected, which mimics 'flooding' the island
        # with water or marking it as visited.
        # Once two parts are connected, we never need to process that connection again.
        # This avoids duplicate work, just like marking visited cells in DFS/BFS. 
        # The union by rank ensures that the tree stays shallow, keeping operations efficient.

        # Union-Find Approach: Connected Components in a Graph
        # Each land cell is treated as a node, and edges exist between adjacent land cells (up, down, left, right).
        # 0. Initialize Trees -> Each land node starts as its own parent with rank 0.
        # 1. Process Root -> iterate over all land cells and prepare them for unions.
        # 2. Process Choices -> union adjacent land nodes (only right and down to avoid duplicates).
        # 3. Ignore Already Connected Nodes -> if two nodes share the same root, skip union, 
        #    which mimics “flooding” the island like marking visited cells in DFS/BFS.
        # Result: the number of unique roots after all unions gives the total number of islands.

## Intro
> You are given a (m) x (n 2D) grid initialized with 
> these three possible values:
> -1 - A water cell that can not be traversed.
> 0 - A treasure chest.
> INF - A land cell that can be traversed. 
> We use the integer 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF.
> Fill each land cell with the distance to its nearest 
> treasure chest. If a land cell cannot reach a
> treasure chest then the value should remain INF.
> Assume the grid can only be traversed up, down, 
> left, or right.
> Modify the grid in-place.

# 684. Redundant Connection ::3:: - Medium

Topics:  Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Union Find, Graph

## Intro
> In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is 
> connected and has no cycles.
> You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes 
> labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The 
> added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, 
> and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is 
> represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi]
> indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.
> Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph 
> is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the 
> answer that occurs last in the input.

|  Example Input           | Output |  
| ---------------- | ------ | 
| edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]] | [2,3] |
| edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]] | [1,4] |

Constraints:

n == edges.length

3 &leq; n &leq; 1000

edges[i].length == 2

1 &leq; ai, &lt; bi &leq; edges.length

ai != bi

There are no repeated edges.

The given graph is connected.
