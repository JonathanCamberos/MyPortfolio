## Arrays & Hashing Intro:

Leetcode problems with elegant solutions using hashing. 

### What is a Hashmap
A dictionary is just a direct mapping of keys->values:

Dictionary: ['a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c' : 3, ...] 

A Hashmap is just a dictionary that maps keys->values using a hash function.
Hashmaps are a common use case for hashing.
We choose hashing to maximize randomness and minimize collisions between elements to keys.

### Hashing
Hashing is simply a function. It takes in an input, and spits out an output.
As an example, here is the function mod, which takes in an integer and spits out an integer:

1 mod (3) = 1

2 mod (3) = 2

3 mod (3) = 0

4 mod (3) = 1

Now this is could be our function for our hashmap, but it would lead to high collisions and low randomness
as there are only 3 possible key results: 0, 1, and 2.
So hashmaps are only efficient as the chosen function.

With a good Hash function:

Insert, Lookup, and Delete take O(1).
In this case, every element gets its own unique key and so
a lookup using this function would be constant O(1).

With a bad Hash function:

Insert, Lookup, and Delete take O(n). 
Lets say our function is hash():

```
    hash()  ->  [key mod (5)]
    hash(10) = 10 % 5 = 0
    hash(22) = 22 % 5 = 2
    hash(31) = 31 % 5 = 1
    hash(14) = 14 % 5 = 4
    hash(17) = 17 % 5 = 2 (collision!)

    Handle collision using chaining with a linked list of elements.

    Index 0  |  Index 1  |  Index 2         |  Index 3  |  Index 4
    -------- | --------- | ---------------- | --------- | ---------
    [10]     |  [31]     |  [22 -> 17]      |  [  ]     |  [14]
```

In this case there are only 5 keys or buckets would be hashed to.
After inserting n elements into one key or bucket, performing a lookup would for some element k 
would result in traversing a list of size n in the worst case leading to O(n).

This would degrade insert, lookup, and delete from the original O(1) to O(n).

Hashmaps having quick O(1) average time for insert(), lookup(), and delete(), 
are great for storing key pairs of lists of elements to perform more complex tasks 
where performance in time and space complexity are important.


### Balancing
Balancing occurs when a hash table has passed its set load factor.

Load Factor = n/m
Where n = num of elements, m = num of keys

Thus, when certain fraction of the table size, say 75% full with 3 elements and 4 potential keys. 
The table must increase in size and rehash/reinsert every element. 

The efficiency of a hash table decreases significantly without balancing, as this leads to increased collisions as the table fills up,
which leads to time needed to resolve collisions, as we traverse through list to find the element in linear time O(n).
Operations like search, insert, and delete, degrade from O(1) on average to O(n) in the worst case.

Usually, when the load factor is reached, the table size doubles to 2n.
And usually, a common load factor is 0.75 or 75% full.
Finally, we must rehash every element leading to:
[(double table size * load factor) - current n elements] = 

(2n * 0.75) - n  =

1.5n - n =

0.5n =

n/2 = additional space after rebalancing

Rehashing is notably expensive as we must rehash every element with the new hash function, 
leading to O(n) for resizing and reinserting n elements.

### Array Application: In place Transformations
Perform transformations or reorderings on the array without using extra space.

Ex: Rotate an array to the right by k steps.
```python
    def rotate(nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        n = len(nums)
        k %= n  # handle cases where k > n
        
        def reverse(start: int, end: int) -> None:
            while start < end:
                nums[start], nums[end] = nums[end], nums[start]
                start += 1
                end -= 1

        reverse(0, n - 1)    # Reverse entire array
        reverse(0, k - 1)    # Reverse first k elements
        reverse(k, n - 1)    # Reverse remaining elements
```

### HashMap Application: Representations

Using a HashMap to represent objects or data based on specific criteria.

Ex: Representing a string by character frequency.
```python
    def freqCount():
        s = "aabbcc"
        freq = {}
        for char in s:
            freq[char] = freq.get(char, 0) + 1
        # freq = {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 2}
```

### HashMap Application: Grouping by Criteria

Group elements based on a defined criterion, such as sorting or categorization.

Ex: Grouping strings that are anagrams of each other:
```python
    def groupAnagrams(strs):
        anagrams = {}
        for word in strs:
            key = "".join(sorted(word))
            if key not in anagrams:
                anagrams[key] = []
            anagrams[key].append(word)
        # anagrams = {'aet': ['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], 'ant': ['tan', 'nat'], 'abt': ['bat']}
```

### HashMap Application: Memoization in Dynamic Programming

Store solutions to subproblems in a HashMap to avoid redundant calculations.

Ex: Fibonacci number computation with memoization:
```python
    def fib(n, memo={}):
        if n <= 1:
            return n
        if n not in memo:
            memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo)
        return memo[n]
```

### HashMap Application: Backtracking with Caching for Pruning

Use a HashMap to cache explored paths or states to prune the search
space effectively. 

Ex: Subset Sum with caching:
```python
    def subsetSum(nums, target):
        # Cache to store paths that can no longer lead to valid solutions
        cache = {}
        result = []

        def backtrack(current, index, total):
            # Check if we've encountered this path before
            state = (tuple(current), total)
            if state in cache:
                return
            cache[state] = True

            # Prune: If the total exceeds the target
            if total > target:
                return
            
            # Valid solution
            if total == target:
                result.append(list(current))
                return

            # Explore further candidates
            for i in range(index, len(nums)):
                # Choose
                current.append(nums[i])
                # Recurse
                backtrack(current, i + 1, total + nums[i])
                # Undo the choice
                current.pop()

        backtrack([], 0, 0)
        return result
```

### HashMap Application: Representing Relationships 

Model relationships between entities.

Ex: Adjacency list representation of a graph:
```python
    def graph():
        edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)]  # List of edges in the graph
        graph = {}  # Initialize an empty hashmap to represent the graph

        # Build the adjacency list
        for u, v in edges:
            if u not in graph:  # If the node `u` is not yet in the graph, initialize it
                graph[u] = []
            if v not in graph:  # If the node `v` is not yet in the graph, initialize it
                graph[v] = []
            graph[u].append(v)  # Add `v` to the list of neighbors for `u`
            graph[v].append(u)  # Add `u` to the list of neighbors for `v`

        # Resulting adjacency list representation
        # graph = {1: [2, 3], 2: [1, 3], 3: [2, 1]}
```

### HashMap Application: Logic Mapping
Use a HashMap to represent problem specific logic or conditions.

Ex: Map complements to indices for quick lookup:
```python
    def twoSum(nums, target):
        # Map to store complement -> index
        complement_map = {}

        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            
            # Check if current number is a complement of a previously seen number
            if num in complement_map:
                return [complement_map[num], i]
            
            # Store complement of current number with index for future lookup
            complement_map[complement] = i

        return []
```

### HashMap Application: Algorithm
Case where a problem that seems to require a HashMap is easily solved by 
an algorithm specifically made for that problem

Ex: Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm
```python
def majorityElement(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    candidate = None
    count = 0

    # Phase 1: Find a candidate for the majority element
    for num in nums:
        if count == 0:  # Reset candidate
            candidate = num
        count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)

    # Phase 2: Confirm the candidate (optional if majority element is guaranteed)
    return candidate
```

### Space & Time Complexity

| ---------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Brute Force (all pairs comparison) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(1) | For each pair of elements, we compare them, leading to quadratic number of comparison O(n<sup>2</sup>)  | No additional memory is allocated O(1) |
| Tim Sort | O(n log n) | O(n) | Tim sort over the array dominates, leading to O(n log n)  | Temporary arrays used during the merge phase dominate, leading to O(n) |
| Hashmap | O(n) | O(n) | Iterate over every element O(n), with O(1) lookup and insertion into the map, leading to linear time O(n) | We store each each element in a hashmap, which requires additional memory proportional to the number of elements O(n) |
| Hashset | O(n) | O(n) | Same logic as Hashmap | Same logic as Hashmap |

| Bug | Error |

| Find the Bug: (iterating element-wise) | Iterating element-wise will cause elements to compare with themselves. | 


### Brute Force: (all pairs comparison)
```python
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:

        # time complexity: iteration of O(n)
        for i in range(len(nums)):

            # time complexity: iteration of O(n^2)
            # 1 + 2 + 3 ... (n - 3) (n - 2) (n - 1) -> 
            # sandwich with reverse sum and cross out like terms -> n(n-1)/2 = O(n^2)
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):

                # time complexity: comparison O(1)
                if nums[i] == nums[j]:
                    return True
        
        # overall: time complexity O(n^2) 
        # overall: space complexity O(1)
        return False
```

| -------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |  ------------ |
| Outer Loop | O(n) | O(1) | Iteration over the list takes linear time O(n) | No additional memory is allocated O(1) |
| Inner Loop | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(1) | For each element in the outer loop, the inner loop iterates through all subsequent elements with Big(O) is O(n<sup>2</sup>). Derivation [here](/Notes/common-formulas#brute-case-double-for-loop) | No additional memory is allocated O(1) |
| Comparison | O(1) | O(1) | Each pair of elements is compared in constant time O(1) | No additional memory is needed for comparisons O(1) |
| Overall | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(1) | The inner loop dominates leading to O(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity.| No additional memory was allocated leading to constant O(1) space complexity. |

   def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        
        # sorts small segment of array using in-place Insertion Sort 
        def insertionSort(arr: List[int], start: int, end: int) -> None:
            
            # insertion sort algo on small segment [start+1, end]
            for i in range(start + 1, end + 1):
                key = arr[i]

## 242. Valid Anagram ::2:: - Easy

Topics:  Hash Table, String, Sorting 

### Intro

> Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different 
word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

|  Example Input 'S'  | Example Input 'T' | Output |  
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------ | 
| "anagram"           | "nagaram"         | true   |
| "rat"               | "car"             | false  |  

Constraints:

String Length: 1 &le; s.length, t.length &le; 5 * 104

Characters: s and t consist of lowercase English letters

### Abstraction

Given a string, we represent its character count as a Hashmap.
We then validate it to the second string character count.

### Space & Time Complexity
|  Solution  | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Time Remark | Space Remark |  
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Brute Force (Merge Sort) | O(n log n) | O(n) | Sorting an individual string O(n log n) dominates as comparing strings by character sequentially is linear O(n) | No additional memory is allocated O(1) |
| Hashmap | O(n) | O(1) | Iteration over the list takes linear time O(n), with O(1) lookup and insertion into the map, leading to linear time O(n) | We store each each element in a hashmap, which requires memory proportional to the number of elements O(n) |
| Hashmap (array of 26) | O(n) | O(1) | Same as logic as Hashmap | Same as logic as Hashmap |

| Bug | Error |

|  Aspect  | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |  Time Remarks | Space Remarks |
| -------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |  ------------ |
| Sorting | O(n log n) | O(n) | Sorting the strings involves recursively dividing the input and merging them back leading to O(n log n) time complexity. Merge sort derivation [here](/Notescommon-formulas#merge-sort). | Temporary arrays are used during merging, leading to O(n) space |
| Comparison | O(n) | O(1) | Comparing the sorted strings character by-element takes linear time | No additional memory is allocated O(1) |
| Overall | O(n log n) | O(n) | Sorting dominates the time complexity as comparison adds negligible overhead leading to O(n log n) time complexity. | Temporary arrays required for merge sort is proportional to input size leading to O(n) space complexity. |

## 1. Two Sum I (Input Array Is Not Sorted) ::1:: - Easy

Topics:  Array, Hash Table 

### Intro
> Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers
> such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, 
> and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

|  nums[]         | Target    | Output |  
| --------------- | ----------| ------ | 
| [2,7,11,15]     | 9         | [0,1]  |
| [3,2,4]         | 6         | [1,2]  |  
| [3,3]           | 6         | [0,1]  |

Constraints:

Only one valid answer exists

Target = n + m, n/m value: 2 &le; nums.length &le; 10^4

Target value: -10^9 &le; target &le; 10^9

### Abstraction
We need to find two elements that add up to the target
and return their indexes.

## 49. Group Anagrams ::2:: - Medium

Topics:  Array, Hash Table, String, Sorting

### Intro
> Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
> An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, 
> typically using all the original letters exactly once.

|  Input                                   | Output                                      |  
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | 
| ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]    | [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]] |
| [""]                                     | [[""]]
| ["a"]                                    | [["a"]]           

Constraints:

strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters

### Abstraction
There are different ways to solve this problem. 

We could then use the Hashmaps of character counts as keys to group anagrams in a list of strings:
Hashmap(Hashmap(charCount) -> [anagram list string]) 

We could sort the string and use that as the key: 
Hashmap ( sorted_string -> [[unsorted anagram string group]])

Lets see:

| Hashmap (array of 26) -> Tuple Key | O(n * k) | O(n * k) | Iterating over the Array takes O(n). Computing character count per string takes O(k). Leading to O(n * k) | Creates a Hashmap per string O(n) for k character key map per string O(k). Leading to O(n * k)|

## 347. Top K Elements in List ::3:: - Medium

Topics:  Array, Hash Table, Divide and Conquer, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue), Bucket Sort, Counting, Quickselect

### Intro
> Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent element within the array. 
> Test cases are generated such that the answer is always unique. You may return the output in any order

|  Input             | k     | Output    |  
| -------------------| ----- | --------- | 
| [1,2,2,3,3,3,3]    | 2     | [2,3]     |
| [7,7]              | 1     | [7]       |

Constraints:

Most Occurrences: 1 &le; k &le; number of distinct elements in nums

Integer value: -1000 &le; nums[i] &le; 1000

### Abstraction
To find the k most frequent elements, we must first create an occurrence counter for each element in the list.
Now that we have the count, we just grab the top k highest occurring elements. 

### Space & Time Complexity
|  Solution  | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Time Remark | Space Remark |  
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Brute Force (Insertion sort) | O(m<sup>2</sup>) | O(n + k) | Insertion sort on m unique elements dominates leadin | |
| Hashmap -> Bucket Sort | O(n) | O(n) | | |
| MinHeap |  |  |  |  |
| Divide and Conquer |  |  |  |  |
| Quickselect |  |  |  |  |

### Brute Force (Insertion sort)
```python
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        
        # space complexity: frequency count for all unique integers O(m)
        count = defaultdict(int)

        # time complexity: iterate over list of n integers O(n)
        for num in nums: 

            # time complexity: insertion operation takes constant O(1)
            count[num] += 1


        # time complexity: iteration for conversion to list takes O(m)
        # space complexity: list size is equal to number of unique integers O(m)
        countTuple = list(count.items()) # [(num, freq), ...]

        # time complexity: Insertion sort 
        # Best case O(m), Average O(m) = O(m^2/2), Worst O(m^2)
        for i in range(1, len(countTuple)):
            key = countTup[i][1]
            j = i - 1

            # while left element is greater than key
            while j >= 0 and countTuple[j][1] < key:
                countTuple[j + 1] = countTuple[j]
                j -= 1
            
            countTuple[j + 1] = key # place key

        # time complexity: grab k top occurring ints from frequency list O(k)        
        result = []
        for i in range(k):
            
            # grabbing int key from tuple [(int, count), ...]
            result.append(countTuple[i][0]) 

        # overall: time complexity  O(m^2) = O(n + m^2 + k)
        # overall: space complexity O(m)
        return result
```
|  Aspect  | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |  Time Remarks | Space Remarks |
| -------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |  ------------ |
| Iteration + Insertion | O(n) | O(m) | Iterating over array of n integers O(n) | Hashmap with m unique elements results in O(m) memory allocation with O(n) in worst case |
| Conversion to list | O(m) | O(m) | Iterating over hashmap to create list takes O(m) | List of tuples stores m (int, count) pairs O(m) |
| Insertion sort | Best O(m), O(m<sup>2</sup>) average, O(m<sup>2</sup>) worst | Insertion sort on tuples of (int, count) sorting by count results in usual time complexity of insertion sort | No additional memory allocation required for in-place insertion sort O(1) |  |

## 238. Product of Array Except Self ::2:: - Medium

Topics:  Array, Prefix Sum

### Intro
> Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is 
> equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
> The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
> You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division 
> operation.

|  Input         | Output          |  
| -------------- | --------------- | 
| [1,2,3,4]      | [24,12,8,6]     |
| [-1,1,0,-3,3]  | [0,0,9,0,0]     |

Constraints:

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer

### Abstraction
Given a list of nums, return a list of nums that is the product of the array except itself.

So, for some num n, the result should be the product of all the numbers to the left of it,
times the product of all the numbers to the right of it:

```
Array:           [   2,    3,    4,    5,    6  ]

Prefix:          [   1,    2,    6,   24,  120  ]
x
Postfix:         [ 360,  120,   30,    6,    1  ]
=
Result:          [ 360,  240,  180,  120,  120  ]
```

To calculate the prefix, we can just iterate over the array multiplying each integer.
To calculate the postfix, we can just iterate over the array backwards multiplying each integer. 
To calculate the result array, we can just iterate over both prefix and postfix arrays multiplying corresponding index values.

This would lead to O(n) = O(3n) for time and O(n) = O(3n) space. 
Now lets see how we can do it in O(1) for space.

### Space & Time Complexity
|  Solution  | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Time Remark | Space Remark |  
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Brute Force (all pairs comparison) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(n) | For each pair of elements, we compare them, leading to quadratic number of comparison O(n<sup>2</sup>) | Memory allocation for result array O(n) |
| Prefix & Postfix | O(n) | O(n) | Three iterations over the array for prefix, postfix, and result calculation O(n) = O(3n)  | Memory allocation for prefix, postfix, and result arrays O(n) = O(3n) |
| Prefix & Postfix | O(n) | O(1) | Two iterations over the array for prefix and postfix calculations O(n) |  |

### Brute Force (all pairs comparison)
```python
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:

        # space complexity: result array of length n O(n)
        res = [0] * len(nums)

        # time complexity: iterate over list of n integers O(n) 
        for i in range(len(nums)):

            # starting value
            product = 1

            # time complexity: iterate over list of n integers O(n)
            for j in range(n):

                # skip current index i while multiplying
                if i != j:

                    # time complexity: multiplication operation takes constant O(1)
                    product *= nums[j]
                
            # time complexity: insert operation takes constant O(1)
            res[i] = product
        
        # overall: time complexity  O(n^2)
        # overall: space complexity O(n)
        return res
```

## 36. Valid Sudoku ::2:: - Medium

Topics:  Array, Hash Table, Matrix

### Intro
> Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
> Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
> Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
> Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Constraints:

A Sudoku board that is partially filled could be valid, but not necessarily solvable.
Only the currently filled cells need to be validated.

|  Input         | Output          |  
| -------------- | --------------- | 
| a sudoku table is too big to put here lol | just look at -> [sudoku board example](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/description/) | 

### Abstraction
With sudoku, valid boards , we have rows  are looking for duplicates much like the original 217. Contains Duplicates.

The only difference here, is that we are looking for duplicates in 3 sets along the rows, columns, and 3x3 squares.

So we simply create sets for all of these groups and as we traverse the board, we check for duplicates

| -------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |  ------------ |
| Row, Col, Box Initialization | O(1) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) |  | Memory allocation for n rows, cols, boxs, of n length O(n<sup>2</sup>) |
| Iterating over all cells | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(1) | Iterating over n x n board O(n<sup>2</sup>) | No additional memory allocation for iteration O(1) |
| Lookup | O(1) | O(1) | Lookup operation takes constant O(1) | No additional memory allocation for lookups O(1)  |
| Insertion | O(1) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | Insertion operation takes constant O(1) | List of n lists each of n length O(n<sup>2</sup>) | 
| Overall | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | O(n<sup>2</sup>) | Iterating over all cells in n x n board dominates, leading to O(n<sup>2</sup>) | List of n lists of n length dominates leading to O(n<sup>2</sup>)  |

Note: Solution 1.2 is faster than Solution 1:

While sets are efficient for large data due to constant time insert, lookup, delete, 
for a fixed-sized 9x9 board like this, the overhead of defaultdict and 
set operations is slower than the [[]] solution. 

## 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence ::3:: - Medium

Topics:  Array, Hash Table, Union Find

### Intro
> Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements.
> A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater than 
> the previous element
> You must wrtie an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

|  Input                    | Output  |  
| ------------------------- | ------- | 
| [2, 20, 4, 10, 3, 4, 5]   | 4       | 
| [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 1, 1]  | 7       |


Constraints:


### Abstraction
Give a list of integers, find the longest sequence of increasing integers 
A longest consecutive sequence on a number line would look like this:

```
Sequence of length 4:     [ 1,  2,  3,  4,  2  ]
Sequence of length 3:     [ 3,  5,  9,  10, 4  ]
```
