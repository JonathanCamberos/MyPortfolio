# A Star Heuristic Algorithm Intro

## Intro
A* is a graph search algorithm used to find the shortest path from a start node
to a goal node efficiently

Combines Dijkstra's Algorithm with a heuristic function to guide the search.

Uses f(n) = g(n) + h(n):
    - g(n): cost from start to current node
    - h(n): estimated cost from current node to goal (heuristic)

The heuristic helps prioritize nodes likely to lead to the goal,
making it faster than Dijkstras in many cases.

## Graph Requirements
1. Weighted Graph (non-negative weights for correctness)
2. Directed or Undirected
3. Heuristic function h(n) must be admissible (never overestimates the true cost)
4. Represented Using:
    - Adjacency List
    - Grid or coordinate system for spatial problem

## Output
Shortest path from start to goal
Total path cost
Optionally the sequence of nodes visited

## Pseudo Code
```python
    def a_star(graph, start, goal, h):

        open_set = []
        heapq.heappush(open_set, (h(start), 0, start, [start]))  # (f = g+h, g, node, path)

        visited = set()

        while open_set:
            f, g, node, path = heapq.heappop(open_set)

            if node == goal:
                return path, g

            if node in visited:
                continue
            visited.add(node)

            for neighbor, cost in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    g_new = g + cost
                    f_new = g_new + h(neighbor)
                    heapq.heappush(open_set, (f_new, g_new, neighbor, path + [neighbor]))

        return None, float('inf')  # no path found
```

## Time Complexity
Best case (good heuristic): O(E) only relevant nodes explored

Worst case (bad heuristic) O(E log V), becomes Dijkstras

## Space Complexity
Priority Queue: O(V)
Visited Set: O(V)
Path Storage: O(V)

## IRL Use Case
- Path Finding In Games
    NPC movements on maps, grids or graph navigation

- GPS Navigation
    Shortest path considering estimated distance to destination

- Robotics
    Efficient movement planning for autonomous robots

## Intro
> You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. 
> You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed 
> edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source 
> node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for 
> a signal to travel from source to target.
> We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the
> minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the 
> signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the 
> signal, return -1.

|  Example Input           | Output |  
| ---------------- | ------ | 
| times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2 | 2 |
| times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1 | 1 |
| times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2 | -1 |

Constraints:

1 &leq; k &leq; n &leq; 100

1 &leq; times.length &leq; 6000

times[i].length == 3

1 &leq; ui, vi &leq; n

ui != vi

0 &leq; wi &leq; 100

All the pairs (ui, vi) are unique. (i.e., no multiple edges.)

## Abstraction
Given a graph, each node with 1 edges, determine how much time is needed
to get from start node to target node.

```python

        # Dijkstra's Algorithm (Single-Source Shortest Path):
        # We want the minimum time for a signal sent from node k
        # to reach all n nodes in a directed graph with non-negative weights.
        
        # Key Ideas:
        #   1. Model the network as a directed weighted graph.
        #   2. Use a min-heap to always expand the node with the smallest
        #      known signal arrival time.
        #   3. Maintain a dictionary of shortest known times to each node.
        #   4. If all nodes are reached, return the maximum of these times.
        #   5. If some node is unreachable, return -1.

        # Build adjacency list: graph[src] = [(dest, weight), ...]
        # tc: O(edge)
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in times:
            graph[u].append((v, w))

        # sc: O(node)
        heap = [(0, k)]
        
        # Dictionary to track shortest known time to each node
        # Invariant: once a node is added here, its shortest time is finalized
        shortest_time = {}
        
        # tc: each node/edge O(e) processed via O(log n) heap operations O(e log n)
        while heap:

            # Pop node with smallest known arrival time
            time, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
            
            # Skip if this node already has a finalized shortest time
            # (We found a better path earlier)
            if node in shortest_time:
                continue
            
            # Record shortest time to reach this node

            return -1

        # overall: sc O(n + e)
