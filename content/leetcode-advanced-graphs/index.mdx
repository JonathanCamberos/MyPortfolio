# 743. Network Delay Time ::1:: - Medium

Topics:  Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Graph, Heap (Priority Queue), Shortest Path

## Intro
> You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. 
> You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed 
> edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source 
> node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for 
> a signal to travel from source to target.
> We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the
> minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the 
> signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the 
> signal, return -1.

|  Example Input           | Output |  
| ---------------- | ------ | 
| times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2 | 2 |
| times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1 | 1 |
| times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2 | -1 |

Constraints:

1 &leq; k &leq; n &leq; 100

1 &leq; times.length &leq; 6000

times[i].length == 3

1 &leq; ui, vi &leq; n

ui != vi

0 &leq; wi &leq; 100

All the pairs (ui, vi) are unique. (i.e., no multiple edges.)

## Abstraction
Given a graph, each node with 1 edges, determine how much time is needed
to get from start node to target node.

```python

        # Note:
        # Why Dijkstras algorithm
        # Dijkstras algorithm is designed to find the shortest path 
        # from a single source to all nodes in a weighted graph 
        # with non-negative edge weights, which fits this case

        # 2. MinHeap to always expand node with smallest current time
        # 3. Track shortest times to each node in a dictionary
        # 4. If all nodes are reached, return max shortest time
        # 5. If some node is unreachable, return -1

# 332. Reconstruct Itinerary ::1:: - Hard

Topics:  Depth First Search, Graph, Eulerian Circuit

## Intro
> You are given a list of airline tickets where 
> tickets[i] = [fromi, toi] represent the departure and the
> arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the
> itinerary in order and return it.
> All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from 
> "JFK", thus, the itinerary must begin with "JFK". If 
> there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return 
> the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when 
> read as a single string.
> For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a 
> smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
> You may assume all tickets form at least one valid 
> itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.

|  Example Input           | Output |  
| ---------------- | ------ | 
| tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]] | ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"] |
| tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]] | ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"] |

Constraints:

1 &leq; tickets.length &leq; 300

tickets[i].length == 2

fromi.length == 2

toi.length == 3

fromi and toi consist of uppercase English letters.

fromi != toi

## Abstraction

## Solution 1: Hierholzers Algorithm Eulerian Path via DFS + MinHeap for Lexical Order - Advanced Graphs/Advanced Graphs
```python
    def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
        
        # Note:
        # Why Hierholzers Algorithm?
        # Hierholzers algorithm is designed to find an Eulerian path or 
        # circuit in a graph a path that uses every edge exactly once.
        
        # In our case:
        # Flight ticket -> edge
        # Must use all tickets once -> Eulerian path
        # Start -> "JFK"

        # Note:
        # 1. Build graph: graph[src] = MinHeap of destinations
        #    (MinHeap ensures lexical order when multiple choices exist)
        # 2. Use DFS to traverse graph:
        #      Always choose the smallest lexical destination first
        #      Remove tickets (edges) as we use them
        # 3. Append airports to itinerary in post-order (after visiting neighbors/edges)
        # 4. Reverse itinerary at the end to get correct order starting at JFK
        # Result -> shortest path through all airports starting at jfk

# 269. Alien Dictionary ::1:: - Hard

Topics:  Breadth First Search, Graph, Topological Sort

## Intro
> There is a foreign language which uses the latin 
> alphabet, but the order among letters is not
> "a", "b", "c" ... "z" as in English.
> You receive a list of non-empty strings words from the
> dictionary, where the words are sorted 
> lexicographically based on the rules of this new 
> language. 
> Derive the order of letters in this language. If the order 
> is invalid, return an empty string. If there are multiple 
> valid order of letters, return any of them.
> A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b 
> if either of the following is true:
> The first letter where they differ is smaller in a
> than in b.
> a is a prefix of b and a.length < b.length.


|  Example Input           | Output |  
| ---------------- | ------ | 
| ["z","o"] | "zo" |
| ["hrn","hrf","er","enn","rfnn"] | "hernf" |

Constraints:

The input words will contain characters only from lowercase 'a' to 'z'.

1 &leq; nums.length &leq; 100

1 &leq; words[i].length &leq; 100


## Abstraction
Given a foreign language, derive the order of letters.

        # Topological sort -> Finding a valid order of characters
        # Finding a valid order of characters is equivalent to performing
        # a topological sort on this graph.
        # If cycle exists, no valid order exists

        # Note:
        # 1. Build a graph of character dependencies from adjacent words
        # 2. Count in-degrees for each character
        # 3. Use BFS to perform topological sort
        # 4. Detect cycles: if result length != total unique chars, return ""

# 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops ::1:: - Medium

Topics:  Dynamic Programming, Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Graph, Heap (Priority Queue), Shortest Path

## Intro
> There are n cities connected by some number of  
> flights. You are given an array flights where 
> flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that
> pricei.
> You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, 
> return the cheapest price from src to dst with at 
> most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.


|  Example Input           | Output |  
| ---------------- | ------ | 
| n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1 | 700 |
| n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1 | 200 |

Constraints:

1 &leq; n &leq; 100

0 &leq; flights.length &leq; (n * (n-1) / 2)

flight[i].length == 3

0 &leq; fromi, toi &lt; n

fromi != toi

1 &leq; pricei &leq; 10<sup>4</sup>

There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.

0 &leq; src, dst, k &lt; n

src != dst

## Abstraction
Given flights, determine the cheapest flights under k stops.
