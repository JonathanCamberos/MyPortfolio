# Forward

## Companies Goals

System design interviews have been widely adopted because the communication 
nad problem solving skills tested in these interviews are similar to those
required by a software engineer's daily work.

The interviewee is evaluated based on how they analyze a vague problem
and solve the idea step by step.

Additionally, the abilities tested also involve how they explain the idea,
discuss with others, and evaluate and optimize the system.
