## Hiring Company Perspective

System design interviews have been widely adopted because the communication 
nad problem solving skills tested in these interviews are similar to those
required by a software engineer's daily work.

The interviewee is evaluated based on how they analyze a vague problem
and solve the idea step by step.

Additionally, the abilities tested also involve how they explain the idea,
discuss with others, and evaluate and optimize the system.

## System Design Questions

The questions are usually open ended, just like in the real world, 
and the desired outcome is to come up with an architecture to achieve
the intended design goals.

Interviewers may choose high level architecture to cover all aspects or 
pick one or more areas to focus on.

The intended design goals are the requirements, constraints, and bottlenecks
that shape the direction of both the interviewer and interviewee.

## Scope Of This Book

The objective is to provide a reliable strategy to approach the system design
questions and to solidify the strategy and knowledge needed for a successful
interview.

## Single Server Setup: Starting Simple

### Intro

Lets start simple and run everything on a single server.
Here, the application code, database, cache, etc. are all running
on a single server.

### Single Server: Processing Steps

1. Client -> DNS
{/* def: topic=DNS id=1 perspective=API diagramId=dns-basic */}
DNS: Users access websites through domain names, (e.g., www.google.com)
The Domain Name System (DNS) resolve those domain names into IP addresses.
DNS is usually provided by third parties (registrars, hosting providers, 
dedicated DNS services) rather than hosted on the application's own servers.
{/* end */}

2. IP Address

{/* def: topic=IP Address id=1 perspective=API diagramId=dns-basic */}
IP Address: An Internet Protocol (IP) address is the numerical label assigned
to a device on a network.
It is returned to the browser or mobile app after a DNS lookup so the client 
knows where to send requests.
{/* end */}


3. HTTP/JSON Request

Once the client receives the IP address, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
or JSON requests are sent to the server.

4. HTML/JSON Response

The server returns HTML pages or JSON responses for rendering.

               | Web Browser, Mobile App |                      |  DNS   |     
               +-------------------------+                      +--------+    
                        |        ^            2) <------

                        |        |    
                        |        |       
                        |        |      
                        V        |
                    +------------------+
                    |   Web Server     |
                    +------------------+

### Client Traffic Sources: Users

Client via a web application or mobile application

- Def: Web Application: A client web application instance uses a combination 
of server-side languages (Java, Python, etc) to handle logic, storage, etc.,
and client-side languages (HTML, JavaScript, etc) for presentation

- Def: Mobile Application: HTTP protocol is the communication protocol between
the mobile app and the web server. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is the 
most commonly used API response format to transfer data due to its simplicity.

## API

{/* def: topic=API id=1 perspective=definition */}
API: An API, Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules or defined contract 
that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.

Rules:
- What endpoints exits
- Defined valid inputs
- Expected outputs and errors

This contract allows different systems, such as a client and server, to work together
them to work together.

1. Request: A client/user sends a request through the API
2. Processing: The API forwards the request to the server
3. Response: The server processes the request and sends the response back to the api
4. Delivery: The API returns the server's response to the client
