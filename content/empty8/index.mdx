### Server.Summary

Our server will be responsible for interavcting between the client and our MongoDB backend.


#### Server Introduction

This is a simple python Server! What is a server you ask? 
A server is basically an infinite while loop listening on a socket.
And a socket, is an object created by binding an IP address + a Port number.
Sockets can be thought of as a home address so machines can send labeled packages
to other machines across a network.

In more details -->

#### What is a port?
Lets say:
| Machine      |  IP          | Port Number  |  Socket         |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| Server       | 0.0.0.0      | 4000         | 0.0.0.0:4000   |
| Client 2     | 0.0.0.0      | 5000         | 0.0.0.0:5000   | 
| Client 1     | 0.0.0.0      | 6000         | 0.0.0.0:6000   |

In our case, all applications will be hosted on the same machine.
and since they are hosted locally, their IP address can either be 
127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0

If we were only using IP addresses, our machine would not be able to separate the packets corresponding
to the server or clients because they all have the same IP of 0.0.0.0.
Thus, the port number is how the machine nows where to send packages.

> Common analogy: The IP is the address of a building and the port number is the appartment number.
> Simiarly in computer networks, the IP address corresponds to a machine, and the port number is the 
virtualisation identifier defining a application endpoint.

Some applications have set port numbers: ssh -> port 22, MongoDB -> port 27017.
So if you want to send info to a specific application hosted on a machine, you know which port to send to.

#### What is a Socket?
A socket is simply the binding of the 'IP + Port number'.
In other words it is a logical endpoint instance in a network connection. 
The client and server each have their own socket in a two-way networking conncetion.
Usually, a machine only has 65545 ports available which limits the number of total possible sockets as well.

#### Listening.py

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':

    # 1.1 - Server Information
    # Use '0.0.0.0' to listen on all available interfaces
    server_ip = '0.0.0.0'  
    default_port = 4000

    # 1.2 - Creating Server Socket 
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    server_socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)

    #1.3 Binding to Server Socket Object
    server_socket.bind((server_ip, default_port))

    #1.4 - Listen on that Server Socket (Port)
    server_socket.listen()
```

As mentioned, both the client and server each need their own socket to communicate. 
Here we are creating the server socket object and call .listen() on that 
server socket object which sets it as ready for accepting connections.

A server should 'idealy' never turn off and always be listening
for new connections/communication which is why we create a infinite loop below which keeps the 
program running and thus the socket instance always ready to accept connections

#### Handshake.py

Now that we are constantly listening on a socket, 
we need a way to detecting if a client is trying to communicate with us.
This has multiple steps so lets break it down   

First, we must be able to recieve the intial connection from the client

```python
#2.0 - Creating empty read, write, and exception socket queues
rlist, wlist, xlist = [], [], []
socket_error = False

#2.1 - Infinite Loop to Keep Server Constantly listening for Client Information
server_on = True
while server_on:

    #2.2 - reseting read file descriptor and read list queue
    rfds = []
    rlist = []

    #2.3 - Add Server Socket to read list 
    #   (we can read on our own sock to recieve new handshakes from client's)
    rlist.append(server_socket)

    #2.4 - Select function:
    #   Chooses sockets from the 3 queues and moves to corresponding file descriptors
    #   Sets socket as ready to read/write/throw exception
    rfds, wfds, xfds = select.select(rlist, wlist, xlist, 5)

    #2.5 - Check Read File Descriptors 
    #   Does server socket has something to read? (not empty)
    if rfds != []:

        # 2.6 - find the server_socket in read file descriptor
        for r in rfds:
            if (r.fileno == -1):
                print("Error -1")
                continue

            # 2.6 - Check if current read file descriptor matches server_socket
            if (r == server_socket):

                # 2.7 recieve initial handshake from client 
                recv_handshake_from_client(server_socket)
                continue
```

Here, we are created 3 lists for reading, writing, and exceptions.
These serve as queues for communication with clients.
To recieve an initial handshake from a client, we need check if our server_socket
is has something to read (server_socket has queued in rlist) and then move our server_socket
to ready to read (queue )



```python 
class Peer:
    def __init__(self, id_number, peer_ip_addr, peer_port, sd):
        self.peer_id = id_number
        self.peer_ip_addr = "0.0.0.0"
        self.peer_port = peer_port
        self.sock = sd
```

These arrays are effectly queues/lists for sockets and thus for client communication 
Effectly we are keeping track of a (IP:Port_Number) that is marked as interested in communcation.

1. rlist: readlist      - program has queued socket to read. 
2. wlist: writelist     - program has queded socket to send to.
3. xlist: exceptionlist - program has queued sockets for exceptions

Great! So we can detect now and control in what order we will communicate with clients. 
Therefore we need a way of keeping track of the conversations we are having via client_state_list:

#### Handshake.py
The concept of a handshake in computer networks is in the case of a two-way networking connection, initially,
both the client and server sockets are idile. Meaning that neither of eachother aware of the others existence.
Beofre and data case be communicated between them, they must establish a connection, or in otherwords, perform
a handshake.

After this handshake, the server will save the clients socket in its client_state_list and client will do the
same for the server.

A client_state_list is an array of Peer objects that the current machine is communcating with. A Peer object
can simply be a Peer_id alongside a socket (IP:Port_Number).

```python
class Peer:
    def __init__(self, id_number, peer_ip_addr, peer_port, sd):
        self.peer_id = id_number
        self.peer_ip_addr = "0.0.0.0"
        self.peer_port = peer_port
        self.sock = sd
```

Now, in our case, we have a server and a client. Lets start with the common case. Our server is idle and waiting
for a client to communicate with it. A client comes along and wants to view their bank account balance.
It is up to the client to begin the handshake with the server as it is the one initially requesting information.

Thus, it is the server's role to listen on its rlist (readlist queue) for incoming handshakes from clients.

```python
    #2.0 - Creating empty file descriptors lists needed for select call below
    #      Each file description is in charge of 
    #           - Listening if a client has sent a message
    #           - Prepare to send a message to a client  
    rlist, wlist, xlist = [], [], []
    socket_error = False

    print("Before Entering While loop -")
    print(f"Client State List: {client_state_list}")

    #2.1 - Infinite Loop to Keep Server Constantly listening for Client Information
    server_on = True
    while server_on:
        print("Listening")

         #2.2 -
        rfds = []
        rlist = []

        #2.3 - Add Servers Read Socket to rlist (for new handshakes from client's)
        rlist.append(server_socket)
        print(f"rlist: {rlist}")

        #2.4 - Select socket function:
        rfds, wfds, xfds = select.select(rlist, wlist, xlist, 5)

        #2.5 - Check Read File Descriptors 
        if rfds != []:
             for r in rfds:
                if (r.fileno == -1):
                    print("Error -1")
                    continue

                if (r == server_socket):
                    print("Recieving handshake from client")
                    recv_handshake_from_client(server_socket)
                    continue
```



Lets saw the server just started 


- Read List:  
  A list of sockets that the program is interested in for reading.
  If data is available for reading on any of these sockets, select will return,
  indicating that I/O is possible on one or more of them.

- Write List: 
  A list of sockets that the program is interested in for writing
  If it's possible to write data to any of these sockets without blocking,
  select will return.     
 
- Error List: 
  A list of sockets that the program is interested in for exceptions 
  (e.g., out-of-band data).  If an exceptional condition occurs on any of these sockets, 
  select will return.
