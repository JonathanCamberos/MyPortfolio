## Intro

As we go through leetcode problems, algorithms or modifications of algorithms
tailored for specific problems will start to pop up. 
This page will take note of those that are practical and interesting.


## Quickselect

Leetcode: 347. Top K Frequent Elements

### Intro
Quickselect is a selection algorithm modified from Quicketsort. 
Its used to efficiently find the k-th smallest or largest element in an unordered list.

Its similar to Quicksort but only sorts the necessary partition
making it faster than fully sorting the entire list.


## Shunting yard algorithm (to-do)

Leetcode: 150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

### Intro


## Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

### Intro 
Given an array nums, find the majority element.

At first glance, it appears you need to use a hashmap to count the frequency of all elements to find the majority element efficiently.

The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm,
takes advantage of the guarantee that the majority element appears more than half the time.

It uses a single pass through the array to identify a candidate majority element by "canceling out" non-majority elements.

No explicit counting or storage of frequencies is needed, making it an elegant solution.

```python
def majorityVote(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    candidate = None
    count = 0

    # Phase 1: Find a candidate for the majority element
    for num in nums:
        if count == 0:  # Reset candidate
            candidate = num
        count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)

    # Phase 2: Confirm the candidate (optional if majority element is guaranteed)
    return candidate
```
