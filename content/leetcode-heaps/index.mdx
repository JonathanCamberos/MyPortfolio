## Heaps intro

a ordered queue! 

### Heap Application: Heap
something something 

Ex: Basic Trie
```python
    def someHeap(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> str:
        
```

## 703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream ::1:: - Easy

Topics:  Tree, Design, Binary Search Tree, Heap (Priority Queue), Binary Tree, Data Stream

### Intro
> You are part of a university admissions office and need to keep  
> track of the kth highest test score from applicants in real-time. 
> This helps to determine cut-off marks for interviews and admissions
> dynamically as new applicants submit their scores.
> You are tasked to implement a class which, for a given integer k, 
> maintains a stream of test scores and continuously returns the kth 
> highest test score after a new score has been submitted. More 
> specifically, we are looking for the kth highest score in the sorted 
> list of all scores.
> Implement the KthLargest class:
> KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the 
> integer k and the stream of test scores nums.
> int add(int val) Adds a new test score val to the stream 
> and returns the element representing the kth largest element 
> in the pool of test scores so far.

|  Example Input           | Output |  
| ---------------- | ------ | 
| ["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"] [[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]] | [null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8] |
| ["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add"] [[4, [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 3]], [2], [10], [9], [9]] | [null, 7, 7, 7, 8] |

Constraints:

0 &leq; nums.length &leq; 10<sup>4</sup>

1 &leq; k &leq; nums.length + 1

-10<sup>4</sup> &leq; nums[i] &leq; 10<sup>4</sup>

-10<sup>4</sup> &leq; val &leq; 10<sup>4</sup>

At most 10<sup>4</sup> calls will be make to add.

### Abstraction
Implement a heap that will keep track of the kth highest score for a data stream.

### Solution 1: heap - Heap/Heap
```python
class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: list[int]):
        # Note:
        # 1. Maintain a min-heap of size k containing the k largest elements seen so far.
        # 2. The heap root (heap[0]) is the kth largest element.
        # 3. When adding a new element:
        #    - If heap size < k, push new element.
        #    - Else if new element > heap root, pop root and push new element.
        # 4. This ensures O(log k) time per add.
        
        self.k = k
        self.minHeap = []
        
        for num in nums:
            self.add(num)
    
    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        # If heap size less than k, just push val
        if len(self.minHeap) < self.k:
            heapq.heappush(self.minHeap, val)
        else:
            # Only add val if it is larger than the smallest element in heap (heap root)
            if val > self.minHeap[0]:
                heapq.heapreplace(self.minHeap, val)
        
        # The kth largest element is always at heap root
        return self.minHeap[0]
```
