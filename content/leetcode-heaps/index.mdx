## Heaps intro

LeetCode problems with heap solutions. 

### What is a Heap
Heaps are specialized complete binary tree structures used to prioritize data.

A heap maintains a partial order property:

1. MinHeap: Parent nodes are less than or equal to their children (smallest element at root)
2. MaxHeap: Parent nodes are greater than or equal to their  children (largest element at root)

The tree is complete: all levels are fully filled except possible the last, 
which is filled left to right 

Peek(): efficient access to min/max element in O(1) time
Insert()/Pop(): Heap edit in O(log n) time

### Heap Characteristics

Heaps are characterized by: 

1. Nodes: Contain values arranged by heap property
2. Complete Tree: Shape property ensures tree is always balanced
3. Heap Property: Parent value &leq; (minHeap) or Parent value &geq; children values
4. Nothing beyond heap property: No ordering between siblings or subtrees maintained, other than parent child from heap property
5. Array: Implemented as array for space and cache efficiency

### Heap Representation
Tree heap represented as an array:

```python
    Array Form
    Index:  0   1   2   3   4   5   6
    Value: [3,  5,  8,  9, 10, 12, 15]

    Tree Form

            (0)3
            /     \
        (1)5       (2)8
        /   \      /   \
    (3)9  (4)10 (5)12 (6)15
```

### Heap IRL
Priority Queues: scheduling, bandwidth management
Graph algorithms: Dijkstra's shortest path, Prim's MST
Event simulation: process events by priority/time

### Heap Application: Top K Element Extraction
We can maintain a heap to quickly retrieve the top K largest
or smallest elements without fully sorting the input.

Ex: Find the kth largest element in array
```python
    def kthLargest(nums, k):
        heap = []
        for num in nums:
            heapq.heappush(heap, num)
            if len(heap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(heap)  # Keep only top K elements
        return heap[0]

    # Example: kthLargest([3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4], 2) -> 5
```

### Heap Application: Dual Heap Balancing Representing Secondary Property
We can use two heaps, maxHeap for lower half of values and a 
minHeap for the upper half, to maintain a property while adding
and removing elements. 
Pattern supports quick lookups of medians, balance points, 
or range constraints.

Ex: Maintain median of stream.
```python
class MedianFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.low = []   # Max-heap (invert values)
        self.high = []  # Min-heap
    
    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        heapq.heappush(self.low, -num)
        heapq.heappush(self.high, -heapq.heappop(self.low))
        if len(self.low) < len(self.high):
            heapq.heappush(self.low, -heapq.heappop(self.high))
    
    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        if len(self.low) > len(self.high):
            return -self.low[0]
        return (-self.low[0] + self.high[0]) / 2        
```

### Heap Application: K Way Merge for Sorted Streams
A minHeap can efficiently merge multiple sorted lists or streams by
always extracting the next smallest element across all inputs.

Ex: Merge k sorted lists into one sorted lists
```python
def mergeKSorted(lists):
    heap = []
    for i, lst in enumerate(lists):
        if lst:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lst[0], i, 0))
    
    result = []
    while heap:
        val, list_idx, elem_idx = heapq.heappop(heap)
        result.append(val)
        if elem_idx + 1 < len(lists[list_idx]):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (lists[list_idx][elem_idx+1], list_idx, elem_idx+1))
    return result

# Example: mergeKSorted([[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]) -> [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]   
```

### Heap Application: Best First Search or Breadth First Search with Priority
A heap can drive a search algorithm where you can expand the 'best' 
candidate first: A*, Dijkstra's, Prims, etc.
In a non negative weighted graph context: a minHeap can be 
used to expand on the closest node first in a 
This always ensures that the next node popped from the heap has
the smallest known distance from the source.

Ex: Dijkstra's Algorithm MinHeap
```python
def dijkstra(graph, start):
    
    # Graph: Node -> list of (neighbor, weight) tuples
    # start: Starting node for shortest path search

    # Result: 
    # dist: shortest distance from start to all other nodes

    # Init all distances to infinity, 
    # except start node which has distance 0
    dist = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    dist[start] = 0

    # minHeap priority queue stores tuples of (distance, node)
    # iterate from start node and commence exploring neighbors
    heap = [(0, start)]

    # while there are nodes to process in heap
    while heap:
        
        # grab node with smallest known distance from start
        d, node = heapq.heappop(heap)

        # Skip if we already have already explored a shorter
        # path to the current node
        if d > dist[node]:
            continue

        # Check each neighbor and see if we have found 
        # a shorter path through the current node
        for nei, w in graph[node]:
            
            # grab new distance
            nd = d + w

            # if shorter path found, update and push to heap
            if nd < dist[nei]:
                dist[nei] = nd
                heapq.heappush(heap, (nd, nei))

    # overall: time complexity
    # overall: space complexity
    return dist
```

### Heap Application: Kth element Within Iterating Sliding Window
A heap can track max/min within a sliding window efficiently when
combined with lazy deletion or index tracking.

Ex: Find maximum in each sliding windows
```python
    def max_sliding_window(nums, k):

        # maxHeap via minHeap with negative values
        # initialize with first k elements
        heap = [(-nums[i], i) for i in range(k)]
        heapq.heapify(heap)

        # root of heap is the largest in the current window
        res = [-heap[0][0]]
        
        # iterate sliding window forward
        for i in range(k, len(nums)):

            # push new element to heap
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-nums[i], i))

            # remove top element if they are outside current window
            while heap[0][1] <= i - k:
                heapq.heappop(heap)

            # after removing out of window elements, heap root is max
            # within the current window
            res.append(-heap[0][0])

        return res
```

### Heap Application: Interval Scheduling Optimization
A minHeap can track the earliest finishing times among active
intervals, enabling optimal scheduling of jobs or meetings without conflicts.

Ex: Find the minimum number of meeting rooms required
```python
    def minMeetingRooms(intervals):

        # Sort intervals by their start time,
        # ensures we process meetings in chronological order
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

        # minHeap to track end time of ongoing meetings,
        # storing the earliest ending meeting at the top
        heap = []

        # iterate over rooms in earliest starting order
        for start, end in intervals:

            # if heap is not empty, and the earliest ending meeting the earliest meeting ends
            # ends before or exactly when the new meeting starts,
            # then we can remove the earliest ending meeting 
            # (essentially freeing up a room)
            if heap and heap[0] <= start:
                # pop meeting that ended the earliest
                heapq.heappop(heap)

            # 'start' the current meeting by pushing it to the heap
            heapq.heappush(heap, end)

        # last heap size is the number meetings running
        # concurrently after all meetings have started
        return len(heap)

    # Example: 
    # minMeetingRooms([[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]) -> 2
```

## 1046. Last Stone Weight ::1:: - Easy

Topics:  Array, Heap (Priority Queue)

### Intro
> You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is 
> the weight of the ith stone.
> We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we 
> choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. 
> Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights 
> x and y with x &leq; y. The result of this smash is:
> If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
> If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the
> stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
> At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.
> Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no 
> stones left, return 0.

|  Example Input           | Output |  
| ---------------- | ------ | 
| stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1] | 1 |
| stones = [1] | 1 |

Constraints:

1 &leq; stones.length &leq; 30 

1 &leq; stones[i] &leq; 1000

### Abstraction
Stone smashing game. Given some amount of stones, a round consists
of smashing the two heaviest stones together. If they are the same weight
both stones are destroyed. If one is heavier than the other, the heavier 
stone loses weight equal to the weight of the less heavy stone.

        #    because sqrt is monotonic and doesn't change order.
        # 3. Approach:
        #    - Use a max-heap (store negative distances) of size k.
        #    - Iterate over points:

### Solution 1: Min Heap of Size k - Heap/Heap
```python
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Note:
        # 1. Maintain a min-heap of size k to keep track of k largest elements.
        # 2. Push elements until heap size is k.
        # 3. For each new element, if it is larger than the smallest in heap (heap root),
        #    pop the smallest and add the new element.
        # 4. After processing all elements, the root of the heap is the kth largest element.
        
        minHeap = []
        
        for num in nums:
            if len(minHeap) < k:
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, num)
            else:
                # Only add if num is larger than smallest in minHeap
                if num > minHeap[0]:
                    heapq.heapreplace(minHeap, num)
        
        # kth largest is at the root of the min-heap
        return minHeap[0]
```

### Solution 2: Modified Quick Select - Heap/Heap
```python
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        
        # Note:
        # 

        # Empty check

        # random pivot
        pivot = random.choice(nums)
        
        # Partition nums into three parts:
        # bigger: elements greater than pivot
        bigger = [num for num in nums if num > pivot]
        
        # If kth largest is in the bigger partition, recurse into it
        if k <= len(bigger):
            
            # recursively go on with this array
            return self.findKthLargest(bigger, k)
        
        # equal: elements equal to pivot
        equal = [num for num in nums if num == pivot]
        
        # If kth largest is within the equal partition, return pivot value
        if k <= len(bigger) + len(equal):
            
            # we found the value and can return it
            return equal[0]
        
        # smaller: elements smaller than pivot
        smaller = [num for num in nums if num < pivot]

        # Adjust k to skip bigger and equal partitions and recurse
        return self.findKthLargest(smaller, k-len(bigger)-len(equal))

## 621. Task Scheduler ::3:: - Medium

Topics:  Array, Hash Table, Greedy, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue), Counting

### Intro
> You are given an array of CPU tasks, each labeled with a 
> letter from A to Z, and a number n. Each CPU interval can 
> be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be 
> completed in any order, but there's a constraint: there has 
> to be a gap of at least n intervals between two tasks with 
> the same label.
> Return the minimum number of CPU intervals required to 
> complete all tasks.

|  Example Input           | Output |  
| ---------------- | ------ | 
| tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2 | 8 |
| ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1 | 6 |
| tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3 | 10 |

Constraints:

1 &leq; tasks.length &leq; 10<sup>5</sup>

tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter

0 &leq; n &leq; 100

### Abstraction
Given a list of tasks marked by uppercase English letters and a minimum
distance n between identical tasks, find how many cycles it would take to 
finish all tasks.

        # Then add the count of tasks with max frequency to the end
        # The result is max between total tasks and this arrangement

## 355. Design Twitter ::2:: - Medium

Topics:  Hash Table, Linked List, Design, Heap (Priority Queue)

### Intro
> Design a simplified version of Twitter where users can post 
> tweets, follow/unfollow another user, and is able to see the 10 
> most recent tweets in the user's news feed.
> Implement the Twitter class:
> Twitter() Initializes your twitter object.
> void postTweet(int userId, int tweetId) Composes a
> new tweet with ID tweetId by the user userId. Each call to 
> this function will be made with a unique tweetId.
> List[Integer] getNewsFeed(int userId) Retrieves the 10 
> most recent tweet IDs in the user's news feed. Each item in 
> the news feed must be posted by users who the user 
> followed or by the user themself. Tweets must be ordered 
> from most recent to least recent.
> void follow(int followerId, int followeeId) The user
> with ID followerId started following the user with ID 
> followeeId.
> void unfollow(int followerId, int followeeId) The 
> user with ID followerId started unfollowing the user with 
> ID followeeId.

|  Example Input           | Output |  
| ---------------- | ------ | 
| ["Twitter", "postTweet", "getNewsFeed", "follow", "postTweet", "getNewsFeed", "unfollow", "getNewsFeed"] [[], [1, 5], [1], [1, 2], [2, 6], [1], [1, 2], [1]] | [null, null, [5], null, null, [6, 5], null, [5]] |

Constraints:

1 &leq; userId, follwerId, followeeId &leq; 500

0 &leq; tweetId &leq; 10<sup>4</sup>

All the tweets have unique IDs.

At most 3 * 10<sup>4</sup> calls will be made to postTweet, getNewsFeed,
follow, and unfollow

A user cannot follow themselves.

### Abstraction
Design a miniTwitter that allows for efficient news feed and postTweet.

## 295. Find Median from Data Stream ::1:: - Medium

Topics:  Two Pointers, Design, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue), Data Stream

### Intro
> The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list.
> If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and
> the median is the mean of the two middle values.
> For example, for arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
> For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
> Implement the MedianFinder class:
> MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.
> void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from 
> the data stream to the data structure.
> double findMedian() returns the median of all 
> elements so far. Answers within 10-5 of the actual 
> answer will be accepted.


|  Example Input           | Output |  
| ---------------- | ------ | 
| ["MedianFinder", "addNum", "addNum", "findMedian", "addNum", "findMedian"] [[], [1], [2], [], [3], []] | [null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0] |

Constraints:

-10<sup>5</sup> &leq; num &leq; 10<sup>5</sup>

There will be at least one element in the data 
structure before calling findMedian.

At most 5 * 10<sup>4</sup> calls will be made to addNum and findMedian
