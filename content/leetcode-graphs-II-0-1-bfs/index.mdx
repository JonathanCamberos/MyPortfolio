# Zero One BFS Algorithm Intro 

## Intro
01 BFS is an efficient shortest path algorithm for graphs where edge weights 
are only 0 or 1

Special case of BFS/Dijkstras

Instead of using a standard priority queue, it uses a deque to achieve O(V + E) time

Efficiently computes shortest distances from a single source in such graphs

## Graph Requirements
1. Weighted graph with edge weights only 0 or 1 only
2. Directed or Undirected
3. Represented Using:
    - Adjacency List

## Output
Shortest distance from the source node to all other nodes
Optionally, the path itself

## Video Animation

## Pseudo Code
```python
    from collections import deque

    def zero_one_bfs(graph, source):

        n = len(graph)
        dist = [float('inf')] * n
        dist[source] = 0

        dq = deque()
        dq.append(source)

        while dq:
            node = dq.popleft()
            for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
                if dist[node] + weight < dist[neighbor]:
                    dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + weight
                    if weight == 0:
                        dq.appendleft(neighbor)  # 0-weight edges prioritized
                    else:
                        dq.append(neighbor)      # 1-weight edges go to back

        return dist
```

## Time Complexity
Each vertex is processed at most once
Each edge is considered at most once

Must faster than Dijkstras for this specific case O(E + V) instead of O(E log V)

## Space Complexity
Distance Array: O(V)
Deque: O(V) in worst case

## IRL Use Case
- Special Graphs
    Slide (0 cost) vs Step (1 cost)

- Network Propagation With Free/Paid Edges
    0 for instance transfer, 1 for delayed transfer

## Intro
> You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. 
> You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed 
> edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source 
> node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for 
> a signal to travel from source to target.
> We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the
> minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the 
> signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the 
> signal, return -1.

|  Example Input           | Output |  
| ---------------- | ------ | 
| times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2 | 2 |
| times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1 | 1 |
| times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2 | -1 |

Constraints:

1 &leq; k &leq; n &leq; 100

1 &leq; times.length &leq; 6000

times[i].length == 3

1 &leq; ui, vi &leq; n

ui != vi

0 &leq; wi &leq; 100

All the pairs (ui, vi) are unique. (i.e., no multiple edges.)

## Abstraction
Given a graph, each node with 1 edges, determine how much time is needed
to get from start node to target node.

## Solution 1: [Dijkstra's] BFS And MinHeap To Keep Shortest Path - Advanced Graphs/Advanced Graphs
```python
    def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:
        
        # Dijkstra's Algorithm (Single-Source Shortest Path):
        # We want the minimum time for a signal sent from node k
        # to reach all n nodes in a directed graph with non-negative weights.
        
        # Key Ideas:
        #   1. Model the network as a directed weighted graph.
        #   2. Use a min-heap to always expand the node with the smallest
        #      known signal arrival time.
        #   3. Maintain a dictionary of shortest known times to each node.
        #   4. If all nodes are reached, return the maximum of these times.
        #   5. If some node is unreachable, return -1.

        # Build adjacency list: graph[src] = [(dest, weight), ...]
        # tc: O(edge)
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in times:
            graph[u].append((v, w))

        # sc: O(node)
        heap = [(0, k)]

        # Invariant: once a node is added here, its shortest time is finalized
        shortest_time = {}
        
        # tc: each node/edge O(e) processed via O(log n) heap operations O(e log n)
        while heap:

            # Pop node with smallest known arrival time
            time, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
            
            # Skip if this node already has a finalized shortest time
            # (We found a better path earlier)
            if node in shortest_time:
                continue
            
            # Record shortest time to reach this node
