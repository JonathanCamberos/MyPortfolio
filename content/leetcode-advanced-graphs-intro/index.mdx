## Traversal Algorithm (Foundation)

### DFS

### BFS

## Shortest Path Algorithms

### Dijkstra's (minHeap) 
Graphs with non negative weights

Dijkstra's Algorithm / Greedy BFS with MinHeap:
Dijkstra is a graph traversal algorithm for finding the shortest path from a single source
to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.
Key Concepts:
    1. BFS Analogy:
        - Similar to BFS layer expansion, but we expand nodes in order of minimum current distance
        - Instead of levels, we prioritize nodes by shortest accumulated distance
    2. Greedy Choice:
        - Always pick the next node with the smallest known distance (via MinHeap)
        - Guarantees that when a node is popped from the heap, its shortest distance is final
    3. Differences vs DFS/BFS:
        - DFS/BFS explores nodes without weights consideration (uniform cost or unweighted)
        - Dijkstra accounts for edge weights and ensures optimal distances incrementally
    4. Graph Representation:
        - Nodes: vertices of the graph
        - Edges: weighted directed edges (u, v, w)
        - Implicit adjacency list or matrix
Result:
    - Shortest distances from source to all reachable nodes
    - Unreachable nodes can be detected if not visited during traversal

## Hierholzer's
Hierholzer's Algorithm / DFS on Graphs:
Hierholzer is similar to DFS on trees, but adapted for graphs with cycles.
Key differences:
    1. DFS on Trees:
        - Visits each node exactly once
        - Appends nodes in post-order (after visiting children)
        - No cycles, so edges are implicitly used exactly once
    2. Hierholzer DFS on Graphs:
        - Visits each edge exactly once (nodes can be visited multiple times)
        - Removes edges as they are used to prevent revisiting
        - Appends nodes in post-order after all outgoing edges are traversed
        - Handles cycles and constructs Eulerian paths or circuits
    3. Analogy:
        - Tree DFS explores nodes, Hierholzer DFS explores edges
        - Post-order ensures correct construction of paths in both
Result:
    - DFS-like traversal that builds a valid Eulerian path using every edge exactly once


## Topological Sorting (DAG Only)

### Kahn's (BFS + Indegree)

### DFS based Topological Sort

## Union Find (Disjoint Set Union)
