# Greedy Intro

LeetCode problems solved with Greedy solutions.

> Greedy problems may be the hardest because as they all follow a pattern, 
> nor are they always intuitive. You just have to come up with a solution 
> that you think should work and hope that it works for all test cases.

and the counter point: 

> in greedy, you always start off by using key observations and reasoning 
> to narrow down your "search space" by eliminating possibilities to get to 
> the answer, i.e. finding scenarios where getting the answer is impossible.
> in this example, it would be realizing a triplet whose value(s) exceed the 
> target are unusable in the merging process and hence can be skipped.
> from there, you can derive what's possible / what are the "search spaces"
> that you actually care about and code up the solution accordingly.
> greedy problems can be quite unstructured, but the code implementation isn't 
> challenging to grasp (like backtracking) or the solution particularly 
> hard to come by (like dp and figuring out the recurrence relation) so it 
> can be a good and fun topic to practice.

## Intro
> Given an integer array nums, find the with the largest sum,

## Solution 1: Greedy Kadane Algorithm Textbook Version - Greedy/Greedy
```python
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        # Kadane's Algorithm (Greedy / 1D DP):
        # The maximum subarray problem can be solved by iterating through the array
        # and maintaining two key variables:
        #   1. local_max -> maximum subarray sum ending at the current index
        #   2. global_max -> maximum subarray sum seen so far
        # At each step, we either:
        #   - Extend the previous subarray (local_max + nums[i])
        #   - Start a new subarray at current element (nums[i])
        # The invariant: global_max always stores the maximum sum encountered

        # num of nums
        # tc: O(1)
        n = len(nums)

        # local_max: max sum ending at current index
        # global_max: overall max sum
        # sc: O(1)
        local_max = nums[0]
        global_max = nums[0]

        # tc: iterate over n O(n)
        for i in range(1, n):

            # At each index:
            # we are deciding whether to extend the array, 
            # or to stop the array and start a new one at the current index

            # extend previous subarray
            extend_prev = local_max + nums[i]

            # start a new subarray at current element
            start_new = nums[i]

            # choose the better option
            local_max = max(start_new, extend_prev)

            # Update global max if current local_max is greater
            # tc: O(1)
            global_max = max(global_max, local_max)

        # overall: tc O(n)

```

## Solution 2: Greedy Kadane Algorithm Practical Version - Greedy/Greedy
```python
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        # Kadane’s Algorithm (Greedy / Practical):
        # The maximum subarray problem can also be solved by maintaining:
        #   1. current_sum -> running sum of the subarray ending at the current index
        #   2. max_sum -> maximum sum seen so far
        # At each step, we either:
        #   - Extend the previous subarray by adding nums[i] (current_sum + nums[i])
        #   - Reset current_sum to 0 if the previous sum would reduce the total
        # This ensures current_sum always represents the best subarray ending at current index
        # max_sum tracks the overall maximum sum encountered

        # Initialize variables
        # sc: O(1)

        # overall max subarray sum
        max_array_sum = nums[0]

        # max sum ending at current index
        subarray_sum = 0

        # tc: iterate over n O(n)
        for num in nums:

            # Extend the previous subarray to include current index
            # tc: O(1)
            subarray_sum += num

            # Decision point: 
            #   - if current index causes subarray_sum to become negative,
            #     it is better to start a new subarray.
            #   - In other words, if current index causes subarray_sum to 
            #     at least be 0 or positive, it should be included.
            if subarray_sum < 0:
                subarray_sum = 0

            # Update max_sum if current_sum is greater
            if subarray_sum > max_array_sum:
                max_array_sum = subarray_sum

        # overall: tc O(n)
        # overall: sc O(1)

        #    crosses the midpoint (ending at mid and starting at mid+1)
        # 3. Build -> recursively compute left, right, cross sums
        # Result -> max sum of array

# 1899. Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet ::1:: - Medium

Topics:  Array, Greedy

## Intro
> A triplet is an array of three integers. You are given a 2D
> integer array triplets, where triplets[i] = [ai, bi, ci]
> describes the ith triplet. You are also given an
> integer array target = [x, y, z] that describes the  
> triplet you want to obtain.
> To obtain target, you may apply the following operation
> on triplets any number of times (possibly zero):
> Choose two indices (0-indexed) i and j (i != j)
> and update triplets[j] to become 
> [max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)]. 
> For example, if triplets[i] = [2, 5, 3] and 
> triplets[j] = [1, 7, 5], triplets[j] will 
> be updated to [max(2, 1), max(5, 7), max(3, 5)] = [2, 7, 5].
> Return true if it is possible to obtain the target 
> triplet [x, y, z] as an element of triplets, or false otherwise.

|  Example Input           | Output |  
| ---------------- | ------ | 
| triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]], target = [2,7,5] | true |
| triplets = [[3,4,5],[4,5,6]], target = [3,2,5] | false |
| triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[1,2,5],[5,2,3]], target = [5,5,5] | true |

Constraints:

1 &leq; triplets.length &leq; 10<sup>5</sup>

triplets[i].length == target.length == 3

1 &leq; ai, bi, ci, x, y, z &leq; 1000

## Abstraction
Given a list of triplets and a target triplet, determine if you can 
select and merge triplets such that each element of the target is 
matched exactly by taking the maximum across chosen triplets.

# 763. Partition Labels ::1:: - Medium

Topics:  Hash Table, Two Pointers, String, Greedy

## Intro
> You are given a string s. We want to partition the string 
> string into as many parts as possible so that each letter
> appears in at most one part. For example, the string 
> "ababcc" can be partitioned into ["abab", "cc"], but 
> partitions such as ["aba", "bcc"] or ["ab", "ab", "cc"] 
> are invalid.
> Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating 
> all the parts in order, the resultant string should be s.
> Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

|  Example Input           | Output |  
| ---------------- | ------ | 
| s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij" | [9, 7, 8] |
| s = "eccbbbbdec" | [10] |

Constraints:

1 &leq; s.length &leq; 500

s consists of lowercase English letters.

# 678. Valid Parenthesis String ::2:: - Medium

Topics:  String, Dynamic Programming, Stack, Greedy

## Intro
> Given a string s containing only three types of 
> characters: '(', ')' and '*', return true if s is valid. 
> The following rules define a valid string:
> Any left parenthesis '(' must have a 
> corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
> Any right parenthesis ')' must have a 
> corresponding left parenthesis '('.
> Left parenthesis '(' must go before the 
> corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
> '*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis 
> ')' or a single left parenthesis '(' or an empty string "".

|  Example Input           | Output |  
| ---------------- | ------ | 
| s = "()" | true |
| s = "(*)" | true |
| s = "(*))" | true |

Constraints:

1 &leq; s.length &leq; 100

s[i] is '(', ')' or '*'
