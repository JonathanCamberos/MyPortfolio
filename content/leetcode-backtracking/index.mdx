## Intro

Backtracking is a technique where we incrementally build candidates 
for solutions and abandon or 'backtrack' a candidate when it cannot
lead to a valid solution. 

The key idea is recursive exploration to build solutions while pruning
invalid branches.

Backtracking commonly leads to high time complexity is often the most practical way
to solve certain types of problem that require an exhaustive search exploring all possibilities.
