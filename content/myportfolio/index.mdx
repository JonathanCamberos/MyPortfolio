### Hi!

Hi, I'm Jonathan. Made this  website to put leetcode + projects im working on to keep up with new technologies. 
Hope you enjoy.

Github:
https://github.com/JonathanCamberos/MyPortfolio 

### How to

I made my portfolio in React.js using other libraries as well, notably:

1. Tailwindcss
2. Contentlayer for MDX
3. Githubslugger
4. Search Engine Optimization
5. Supabase
6. lotsssss of youtube react.js tutorials



Dont need 
--------------
dolottie -> animation
supabase -> view count


Need
---------------
Tailwind -> css
contentlayer -> markdown
github-slugger -> generate slugs
next-sitemap -> generate sitemap, shows url for each blog
                helps search engine index to each blog

react-hook-form -> get response from form
reading-time -> generate reading time 

rehype-autolink -> format and prettier
remark-gfm -> format and prettier




Walkthrough
-------------

Great lets do this step by step just to have documentation for future reference
And we will go down every rabbit hole to explain as my intro into JavaScript


Creating page
-----------------

npx create-next-app@latest .

Would you like to use TypeScript
JavaScript is a loosely typed language.

By definition: A loosely typed language is a programming language that does
not require a variable to be defined.

```javascript
let x = 42;          // x is a number
console.log(typeof x); // Output: "number"

x = "Hello, world!"; // x is now a string
console.log(typeof x); // Output: "string"

x = true;            // x is now a boolean
console.log(typeof x); // Output: "boolean"
```

Whats the opposite? A strongly typed language such as C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 42;          // x is explicitly declared as an integer
    printf("x: %d\n", x);

    x = "Hello, world!"; // Error: incompatible type assignment
    return 0;
}
```

Would you like to use ESLint?

Yes. ESLint, short for "ECMAScript Link", is a tool used in 
JavaScript and TypeScritip development used to catch errors and ensure 
consistency

```javascript
const x = 42;
console.log(y); // ESLint: 'y' is not defined.
```

Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? 

Yes. TailwindCSS simplifies styling and avoids need to write custom CSS 
from scratch

Would you like your code inside a 'src/' directory?

Yes. Organizing files under src/ directory keeps project structure clean
and manageable

Would you like to use App Router?
