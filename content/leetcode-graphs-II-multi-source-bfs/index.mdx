## Traversal Algorithm (Foundation)

### DFS

### BFS

## Shortest Path Algorithms

### Dijkstra's (minHeap) 
Graphs with non negative weights

Dijkstra's Algorithm / Greedy BFS with MinHeap:
Dijkstra is a graph traversal algorithm for finding the shortest path from a single source
to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.
Key Concepts:
    1. BFS Analogy:
        - Similar to BFS layer expansion, but we expand nodes in order of minimum current distance
        - Instead of levels, we prioritize nodes by shortest accumulated distance
    2. Greedy Choice:
        - Always pick the next node with the smallest known distance (via MinHeap)
        - Guarantees that when a node is popped from the heap, its shortest distance is final
    3. Differences vs DFS/BFS:
        - DFS/BFS explores nodes without weights consideration (uniform cost or unweighted)
        - Dijkstra accounts for edge weights and ensures optimal distances incrementally
    4. Graph Representation:
        - Nodes: vertices of the graph
        - Edges: weighted directed edges (u, v, w)
        - Implicit adjacency list or matrix
Result:
    - Shortest distances from source to all reachable nodes
    - Unreachable nodes can be detected if not visited during traversal

## Hierholzer's
Hierholzer's Algorithm / DFS on Graphs:
Hierholzer is similar to DFS on trees, but adapted for graphs with cycles.
Key differences:
    1. DFS on Trees:
        - Visits each node exactly once
        - Appends nodes in post-order (after visiting children)
        - No cycles, so edges are implicitly used exactly once
    2. Hierholzer DFS on Graphs:
        - Visits each edge exactly once (nodes can be visited multiple times)
        - Removes edges as they are used to prevent revisiting
        - Appends nodes in post-order after all outgoing edges are traversed
        - Handles cycles and constructs Eulerian paths or circuits
    3. Analogy:
        - Tree DFS explores nodes, Hierholzer DFS explores edges
        - Post-order ensures correct construction of paths in both
Result:
    - DFS-like traversal that builds a valid Eulerian path using every edge exactly once


## Topological Sorting (DAG Only)

### DFS based Topological Sort

## Union Find (Disjoint Set Union)

## Intro
> You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. 
> You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed 
> edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source 
> node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for 
> a signal to travel from source to target.
> We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the
> minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the 
> signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the 
> signal, return -1.

|  Example Input           | Output |  
| ---------------- | ------ | 
| times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2 | 2 |
| times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1 | 1 |
| times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2 | -1 |

Constraints:

1 &leq; k &leq; n &leq; 100

1 &leq; times.length &leq; 6000

times[i].length == 3

1 &leq; ui, vi &leq; n

ui != vi

0 &leq; wi &leq; 100

All the pairs (ui, vi) are unique. (i.e., no multiple edges.)

## Abstraction
Given a graph, each node with 1 edges, determine how much time is needed
to get from start node to target node.

        # Dijkstra's Algorithm (Single-Source Shortest Path):
        # We want the minimum time for a signal sent from node k
        # to reach all n nodes in a directed graph with non-negative weights.
        
        # Key Ideas:
        #   1. Model the network as a directed weighted graph.
        #   2. Use a min-heap to always expand the node with the smallest
        #      known signal arrival time.
        #   3. Maintain a dictionary of shortest known times to each node.
        #   4. If all nodes are reached, return the maximum of these times.
        #   5. If some node is unreachable, return -1.

        # Build adjacency list: graph[src] = [(dest, weight), ...]
        # tc: O(edge)

        # tc: each node/edge O(e) processed via O(log n) heap operations O(e log n)
        while heap:

                continue
