## 2. Design Ticket Master

Topics: High Contention 

## Functional Requirements ::2::

> Features needed to satisfy the needs of the user.

### In Scope

1. Users should be able to view events

2. Users should be able to search for events 

3. Users should be able to book tickets to events

### Out of Scope

1. Users should be able to view their booked events

2. Admins or event coordinators should be able to add events

3. Popular events should have a dynamic pricing

## Non Functional Requirements ::4::

> Specifications about how a system operates, rather than what tasks it performs.
> Defines system attributes like scalability, latency, security, availability,
> and are often framed as specific benchmarks.
> (e.g., system's ability to handle 100 million daily active users,
> response to queries within 200 milliseconds)

### Benchmarks

1. The system should prioritize availability for searching & viewing events,
but should prioritize consistency for booking events (no double booking)

2. The system should be scalable and able to handle high throughput in the form 
of popular events (10 million users, one event)

3. The system should have low latency search (< 500 ms)

4. The system is read heavy, and thus needs to be able to support high 
read throughput (100:1)

### Out of Scope

1. The system should protect user data and adhere to GDPR

2. The system should be fault tolerant

3. The system should provide secure transactions for purchases

4. The system should be well tested and easy to deploy (CI/CD pipelines)

5. The system should have regular backups
