## MinHeap (to-do)

Leetcode: 347. Top K Frequent Elements

### Intro
A MinHeap is a binary tree with the following conditions:
1. Parent node is smaller than or equal to its children
2. Smallest element is at the root of the tree 
3. Operations are retrieval of the smallest element, as well as insertion and deletion

MinHeaps are implemented using arrays, with the structure
of the binary tree being represented implicitly:

- Parent of node at index i is stored at index: floor[(i-1)/2].
- Left child is at index 2i+1
- Right child is at index 2i+2

Ex:
```
Array Representation: [2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15]

Heap Structure:
         2
       /   \
      4     7
     / \   /
    8  10 15
```

Insert(7):
```
Insert 1 into the array: [2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15, 1]

Heap Structure Before Rebalancing:
         2
       /   \
      4     7
     / \   / \
    8  10 15  1

Perform Bubble Up Check: 1 < 7, so swap

         2
       /   \
      4     1
     / \   / \
    8  10 15  7

Perform Bubble Up Check: 1 < 2, so swap


         1
       /   \
      4     2
     / \   / \
    8  10 15  7

Perform Bubble Up Check: 1 is root. Reached Top 

Result is: [1, 4, 2, 8, 10, 15, 7]
```
