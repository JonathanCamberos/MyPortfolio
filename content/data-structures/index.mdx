## Heap

Leetcode: 347. Top K Frequent Elements

### Intro
A Heap is a binary tree with either of following conditions:

1. MinHeap: Smallest element is at the root. Parent nodes are smaller than or equal to their children. 

2. MaxHeap: Largest element is at the root. Parent nodes are larger than or equal to their children.

Heaps are nearly complete binary trees. Meaning that all levels are fully filled
except for the last, which is filled from left to right.

Heaps are implemented using arrays, either 1-indexed or 0-indexed, and use simple arithmetic to track parents and children.

1-indexed heaps (more common in textbooks):
- Parent of i: floor(i/2)
- Left child of i: 2i
- Right child of i: 2i + 1

```
Indices:      _,  1,   2,   3,   4,   5,   6,   7
1-indexed: [ _,  10,  20,  15,  30,  40,  50,  60 ]

                  10 (1)
               /        \
           20 (2)       15 (3)
         /     \       /     \
     30 (4)   40 (5) 50 (6)  60 (7)
```

0-indexed heaps:
- Parent of i: floor(i-1/2)
- Left child of i: 2i + 1
- Right child of i: 2i + 2

```
Indices:      0,  1,   2,   3,   4,   5,   6
0-indexed: [ 10, 20,  15,  30,  40,  50,  60 ]

                  10 (0)
               /        \
           20 (1)       15 (2)
         /     \       /     \
     30 (3)   40 (4) 50 (5)  60 (6)
```


Heap operations are, push(), pop(), and peek().
In other words, insert(), remove(), and peek()

Push(): O(log n)
Adds a new elements to the bottom right end of the heap, and performs bubbleUp()
to restore the heap property.
This takes O(log n) which correlates with the height of the tree

Pop(): O(log n)
Removes the root, and place the bottom right end element at the root, and performs bubbleDown()
to restore the heap property.

Peek(): O(1)
Returns the root element without modifying the heap.
