## MinHeap (to-do)

Leetcode: 347. Top K Frequent Elements

### Intro
A MinHeap is a binary tree data structure where:
1. The parent node is always smaller than or equal to its children
2. The smallest element is always at the root of the tree 
3. MinHeap operations allow efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of the smallest element

MinHeaps are commonly implemented using arrays, where the structure
of the binary tree is represented implicitly:

Parent of node at index i is stored at index: floor[(i-1)/2].
Left child is at index 2i+1
Right child is at index 2i+2

```
Array Representation: [2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 15]

Heap Structure:
         2
       /   \
      4     7
     / \   /
    8  10 15
```
